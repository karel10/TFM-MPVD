This isn’t some novel concept, it’s basic common sense which literally every kid who went through the American school system had to learn. If there’s an active shooter, you run away, simple as that. 

Hell, I am pretty sure they weren’t even expecting him to fire back given how he was running away from them…. 

My guess is that once they cornered Kyle and he was forced to retaliate then Grosskreutz made up the bullshit about “trying to protect others” when he realized that now there are investigations open around what was going on and was trying to cover his own ass beyond anything else.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770DBF3AC8>

Something doesn’t have to be illegal to be creating a dangerous situation and a public nuisance.  The police identified him as a threat to public safety so they found a legal reason to make him leave, they didn’t come from the school they came from the courthouse.  They knew that Rittenhouse was instigating violence and creating a dangerous situation the night of the protest, they just didn’t care.  Rittenhouse got off because an incompetent prosecutor brought murder instead of manslaughter and because of the politics of the moment.

10,qy8r16,The Rittenhouse Prosecutor didn't do a bad job. He actually did a pretty good job with what he had to work with,xredrumx5150,1637424708.0,11,0.66,37,"First off, I know you're probably tired of Rittenhouse posts by now especially since a lot of them either aren't unpopular or even opinions. But I've had one since the trial started that fits both of those criteria. Sorry if it's already been posted.

I know what you're thinking. ""You're a clown, that was the worst prosecution I've ever seen in my life, he brought up CoD, questioned his 5th amendment rights...etc"" Under normal circumstances I would agree with you, but this is probably the one exception. There was just no evidence, in a perfect world that isn't polarized and everything isn't political this case never makes it to trial. The first guy chased him and threatened to kill him, second guy assaulted him with a skateboard and the third guy was only shot AFTER he pointed his gun at Rittenhouse. That's important because the prosecution had nothing and he knew he had nothing but still had to do his job. His options were either A:Do legit nothing and just sit there, or B:Grasp at any straw he could I.E Call of duty, show the Jury how it feels to be on the other end of an AR15...etc. And I think he did a great job at grasping at straws, I mean the jury actually deliberated on it for more than a day, when I honestly thought it would take less than an hour at first. 

Everyone I've talked to either already knew Rittenhouse would be cleared of charges or realized it was self defense once they looked into the evidence themselves, and while most think he made some stupid fucking choices they all acknowledge that it was clearly self defense. Anyone who looks at the evidence can see it was self defense yet the Prosecutor still had to argue that it wasn't, it was unwinnable from day 1.

I honestly believe that if you gave this case to any Prosecutor in America they wouldn't win it. This man was given an impossible task with a case that should have never made it to trial and he did a good job when you consider that he had next to nothing to work with.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177135A01D0>
11,qy25ek,I feel like abortion is immoral but people just choose to ignore it.,,1637400758.0,3,0.6,8,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

   I want to start this by saying I understand my bias. I've been living in Texas for as long as I can remember. I was raised a Christian and I still am a Christian. My family is all Christian and I've gone to church 95% of all the Sundays I've lived, although my faith still waivers every now and then so I guess I'm not super dedicated. I've tried to separate myself from my bias as well as I can but no one's perfect. I've also considered myself a right leaning centrist If that means anything.

   So on to my point. I believe that if the mothers life is not in danger then abortion should not be legal. However, abortion can be considered in cases of rape. Abortion should not be considered in cases of incest unless it wasn't consensual. Abortion should be a last resort. Those are my thoughts.

   I understand where people are coming from when they say that it's the mothers choice because; ""my body, my choice"". However I disagree. That lump of cells/embryo/first trimester/fetus/baby etc., Is a separate organism with its own DNA. And not just any organism. A HUMAN. No matter what you believe about a baby's consciousness, that baby will eventually become a person. So it's not ""your body"". 

   I feel like people are choosing to ignore this fact and are throwing aside their morals in pursuit of ""personal freedom"". Are we so bored that we're willing to kill people to find something to do?
  
   I feel like there's a solution we're all forgetting here. Talk. To. Some. One. That's it. Talk about your problem. If your not ready to have a baby and your condom broke or your birth control failed. Discuss it with your partner. If you can't agree on something go to a professional who can help. A doctor, Marriage/relationship counselor, fucking gynecologist idk, dont just kill babies because it's inconvenient to you. If you can't talk to your partner because they took off or something discuss with a doctor or someone close to you that you trust. Like a parent or sibling or close friend.

   If you were raped and don't think you can handle a child then discuss with a doctor, legal team, etc. Maybe you can have the child and put them up for adoption. Being in the shitty foster care system is better than not being given a chance at all.

   In cases of incest that isn't rape then the proper punishment should be given to the parents of the child but abortion should still be a last resort. Custody can be given to grandparents or other family members. Adoption is still an option here too.

There are obviously an infinite amount of different circumstances that the mother of the child could be in so I'm willing to discuss in the comments, in fact I encourage it. I think we can all learn something when we stop and think instead of jumping to conclusions.

I'm terrible at getting my thoughts across so I hope you understood me. Things sound great in my head and then I vomit words and hope they make sense.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017711956BE0>

having or including a diverse group of characters in a TV show or movie does not make it worse.

When it comes to adapting source material, I think there is a legitimate argument to be had about changing a character's background, regardless of the reason. There is, at least, a lot of nuance when it comes to that issue. But outside of that situation, too often it seems like people talk about characters being shoehorned/forced in, pandering, being overly PC, etc, and none of these things really track. Nor does it make a property bad (i.e., just because something isn't what you personally want to see doesn't mean it's bad).

However, it's certainly quite unpopular to argue this here, so I think it nicely fits the sub, especially since I've seen the opposite cited. 

To begin, one of the rules of self-defense requires a lack of inducement. Namely, that one doesn't induce the situation they're trying to claim they acted in self-defense. There's been a slew of caselaw on that topic, but the one that sticks in my mind is the case of The People v Crosbie and Meehan, where a group of youths, having had one of the group beaten up earlier, wandered the street with weapons, specifically going to the area where the violence had taken place and where those they wanted to do violence against were. This provoked the other group as they intended, a fight started, and two were killed. The Court found, quickly enough, that actively putting yourself in a situation like that, especially where one has the intent to do violence, was self-inducement, and thus, the same defense couldn't be used here.

It's not hard to see that's what happened here. We have footage of Kyle Rittenhouse only a week or two before, proclaiming how he wished he had his gun as two law-breakers fled, as he'd love to shoot them. Then, Kyle Rittenhouse would later arm himself... and head to an area like this, with what the video evidence shows is a clear intent and desire to use that weapon. 

It's this fact that confirms for us that this wasn't self-defense. Nothing forced Rittenhouse to kill, he actively sought out the opportunity to do so, and thus, regardless of the lengthy debate over the footage, it can't have been self-defense.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017716AD0438>

If I say I like blondes, then that's it. I fail to see the difference between genitals and hair color honestly. Yes, hair can be dyed, so what? If someone wants to break up over hair color or changing genitals, I don't think they need to be shamed for it. 

Same thing with eye size, nose size. I know this is unpopular because if you say you don't like people with large noses or small eyes, I bet people will hate you. like no need to air out your preferences, but if someone finds out you aren't what you look like in your profile, they are allowed to leave. 

When certain demographics, ie Asian men or black women complain how people find them ugly, yeah, I'm sorry, but you can't change attraction. For the record, i like people in general. But its the attitude that needs changing.

But then I realized that their opinions about these immigrants, minority groups and what the normal left was trying to do with CRT weren't based in reality, at all. They act as if combating generational poverty is as easy as snapping your fingers, that things like slavery and segregation weren't as horrible as they were and that saving up money and leaving your family behind for better opportunities is as easy as pie.

Honestly I'm starting to understand why many on the left dislike conservatives the way they do - because they love to talk about issues they don't understand, and believe that everything the left is doing today is just an effort to attack white people, capitalism and destroy America (yes I've seen the instances in which they took it to far such as with the riots [you guys two with January 6th]) but that's really not the case.

For instance alot of people on the right reject the new terms that the left is using to describe discrimination like ""colorism"" because they believe that it's unesscary or just another way to control them.

But what they don't understand is that the left made the term colorism to differentiate from the term racism. Because ""racism"" is when you hate someones racial background regardless of color, while colorism is how people treat people of darker skin tone poorly regardless of race.

I do think it's a bit far with the neo pronouns but not everything the left is doing is to attack you. They're assigning names to these concepts so that people can understand them and recognize it when they are doing it and when they see it.

Now here's where I reach out to my fellow progressives - after all, we are generally the ones more in favour of higher rates of immigration. 

Many people will arrive from parts of the world where such progressive views are not tolerated. I recently saw a video of a woman in my country (the UK) getting told to cover up by an Arabic man as it offends his culture, while shopping in a supermarket (link posted below).

I'm not saying we should be calling those people out specifically, I'm saying that if we don't recognise that such a culture clash can occur, we may see ourselves losing our relatively progressive society.

I firmly believe that the technology behind crypto, and many popular projects have already built infrastructure and systems that have significant value, the same way the internet has value or gaming items do. You may or may not believe that the entire world can change its ways and move to crypto, but at the very least after this you hopefully will agree that crypto has its place in creating a more open alternative to some systems.

Since I'm invested in crypto myself, I want to make it very clear that if I mention any specific crypto projects, it isn't financial advice, nor are positive or negative mentions a reason to invest in them. Do your own research if you do want to invest into crypto, but any coins or tokens that get mentioned will simply be in this thread with the purpose of providing an example.

My goal here is to educate on the premise of how blockchains and crypto work, so that people understand, besides the millions of scams that do exist, there are great projects working on great things, and maybe some of you might be inclined to try out some projects without even expecting any gains!

**So first of all, what are blockchains?**

Blockchains are simply distributed ledgers and computing systems. Now those are two fancy words that essentially mean they are systems, spread across the globe, running on many computers and servers, that track data, as well as allow their users to perform any tasks defined within their specifications. This can be as simple as adding two numbers, or handling a *smart contract* that only pays out insurance money if certain requirements are met. We'll get back to these later.

The benefit of having all the data, and code, running on a distributed system, is that everything is transparent. This doesn't always mean that I can read how much of a certain crypto got sent or received from each wallet, but the code can verify that you're allowed to perform certain transactions, and this is done by multiple people to ensure that trust doesn't need to really exist, since a large portion of people running and validating the network need to agree. This makes blockchains trustless.

**How does crypto play into this?**

Cryptocurrencies are coins or tokens built on top of blockchains. It's very important to understand the difference between a cryptocoin, and a cryptotoken.

Each blockchain needs a way to incentivize those distributed computers and servers I mentioned. Since they're running the computational tasks, and storing all the data on the ledger, they get paid in a cryptocoin. For the Bitcoin network this is BTC, for Ethereum it's ETH, etc. Those fees are usually paid when a transaction is ran on the network, so i.e. if I send from my wallet to yours some ETH, then a transaction fee must be paid and a part of which gets paid to the miners that enabled this transaction to go through, the rest of the transaction fee is destroyed, making ETH deflationary in this case.

There's a lot more that can go into the economics of a cryptocoin, or token. Some of it I might bring up later. In any case, now to the tokens.

Tokens are representations of real-world assets, or completely digital assets, built on top of a blockchain. As they aren't used to pay transaction fees, and aren't built natively on the blockchain they reside on, we call them tokens instead of coins. This could even be something like a house deed, or the ownership certificate of a vehicle, etc. These tokens don't even need to only exist on one blockchain. They can be coded to exist on multiple, such as Solana, Ethereum and Cardano.

Now, not all blockchains make it possible to create a token on their network. Each blockchain has its own approach, often giving the creator of a token a reason to pick one or the other blockchain for their project.

**How can tokens help us?**

Well, a big use-case I see in blockchain technology right now is the use of tokens, which is why it's getting a dedicated section. As I mentioned, tokens are just assets, either representing something in the real-world, or entirely digital. I can tokenize my house deed, as I mentioned, or generate a bunch of even tickets with the right blockchain. Then sell the whole thing digitally, in a trustless and low-fee manner compared to traditional centralized systems.

Those are just some examples I wanted to quickly mention on how tokens can actually have real-world use. On top of that, think about the games we play. LoL accounts, among others, can be sold for thousands of dollars because of the items they possess. Now, some might call it a bubble, or simply dumb, but it shows, that we humans are capable of attributing arbitrary value, to the oddest of things. The same can be seen in certain artwork (IMO, but those buying the art probably see it in a very different light) and playing cards for soccer/football or Pokémon.

All those, more playful, systems, can be tokenized and gamified on blockchain as well. I can write a smart contract that generates a very specific set of cards, which are used in a PvP game, and the better a card's attributes are, the higher likelihood it has in winning a tournament. That's a very basic, and general example of what I'm trying to explain, but hopefully it makes sense.

**What are smart contracts?**

Smart contracts are what really make blockchains as capable as they are today, IMHO. A very straightforward explanation is that a smart contract is some code, that only does something when certain parameters are met. That's why it's called a smart contract, because it only executes its main task, after the contract is signed so to speak. Depending on the blockchain you're working on, smart contracts will have different capabilities, but there are some crazy use-cases for them that I bet some of you will find interesting.

This is where we get a bit more technical. To really understand how great a smart contract can be, you need to know that this code gets deployed on a blockchain by whoever created it, and gets a wallet address of its own just like you or I would on which it can accept transactions or even send them. This means smart contracts can interact with the crptocoins and tokens I mentioned earlier. A smart contract can also keep track of data, kind of like an Excel sheet on the blockchain, that is fully transparent and open. It's trustless, like I said, because you can view the code before interacting with it, to ensure that it truly will do what its creator claims it should.

Because smart contracts have the capabilities I mentioned above, they can be used to validate the authenticity of certain assets. As I mentioned above, those gaming cards would be created by a smart contract, and since the smart contract only does exactly what it's told to do, people can verify that the card is real, by checking if its original creator was the smart contract that runs the game.

On top of that, smart contracts can be used for more than just games. They can be used for voting, open and publicly ran insurances, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), liquidity and swapping protocols, lending protocols, etc.

All those get even more technical. A decentralized autonomous organization, is exactly what it sounds like. A company that doesn't have a CEO, or anyone running its operations. Everything that happens in that company is executed via code. If the smart contract is supposed to change, to e.g. support new features or use-cases, then people would first have to vote on it. The voting systems are always different as well, but a popular example is MakerDAO, which created its own token that people can hold to get voting rights. So essentially anyone can make business decisions by holding the token. This is a popular approach in crypto governance in general.

Liquidity, swapping and lending protocols have to do with DeFi. DeFi stands for decentralized finance, and is a whole new world of taking over the tasks from traditional banks, and putting them on the blockchain. Instead of earning interest through the middleman, who takes a cut, you add your liquidity to a liquidity pool on the blockchain, and make far higher returns. This can even be done with stablecoins, which are essentially coins or tokens pegged to a fiat currency value, so you don't have to worry about the volatility of crypto.

Swapping protocols allow people to trade between currencies without a middleman as well. Instead of a centralized exchange buying millions of crypto so that they have the liquidity when you want to buy it, a DEX (decentralized exchange) will use smart contracts to have the community pool this liquidity, and anyone that adds liquidity, just like with the above mentioned lending protocols, makes a good amount of fees for the risk and effort. I must add that the risk is usually extremely low with well-established DEXes.

I could go on about crypto all day. But the last two things I want to mention, is that crypto really could help some third-world countries, but even first-world countries in a meaningful way. The Cardano developers have been partnering with African nations to introduce better ways in tracking education data, voting turnouts, etc. using blockchain. These systems will be somewhat closed, as they probably will be ran by the government, but they will be leveraging the same blockchain technology we see here in the public system.

On top of that, there are blockchain projects working on early implementations of UBI. If we can ensure that everyone only signs up to said blockchain once, then we can pay out a certain basic income rate which is something some first-world countries direly need in this time of automation.

**Touching on the Metaverse.**

I just want to make a quick note on the Metaverse, as recently it has been a controversial topic with Facebook's rebranding and the parabolic price action of related cryptocurrencies. I think it's interesting, and again, just like traditional games are able to put certain value on items, the Metaverse wants to build a decentralized digital world. So whether you like it or not is up to you, but it's kind of like playing VRChat on steroids. Along with the financial incentives, people are just going to do what they can to get in early. So maybe it's something for you!

**Wrapping up.**

I will admit, blockchain tech, and crypto, still has a long ways to go as of right now. There are some great projects out there building on some awesome ideas, but it's worth nothing that Ethereum still runs on PoW, which uses a fair bit of energy. Luckily, most modern blockchains use PoS, which doesn't, and Ethereum 2.0 will be migrating to it. There are other concerns, such as interoperability, and centralization, that will need to be addressed by projects, to bring crypto into the mainstream. But I think it's worth keeping this technology on your radar, as it might just have the same effect that the internet did to bring knowledge, media and many more opportunities to a wider mass.

That's all for my explanation on cryptocurrencies. I've written a previous thread going over some of the [myths about blockchain technology and crypto](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/qs6v2b/crypto_isnt_just_a_trading_game_or_a_gamble_and/), if you guys are interested. My approach has always been to try and educate people. I don't want to change your minds, if everything I wrote here still has you convinced that crypto isn't for you, that's okay. But I hope everyone makes an informed decision, instead of following influencers and politicians, since they always have a stake, that will go against most of us here.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017716C7BEF0>
52,qs6v2b,"Crypto isn't just a trading game or a gamble, and people who claim to hate capitalism, the government or the rich and then continue to shill for fiat are massive hypocrites.",Dan6erbond,1636705807.0,8,0.65,19,"This post is definitely inspired by a recent argument on Reddit. But as a software engineer with an interest in crypto and where it's headed, I'm just incredibly bothered by the misinformation being spread by people that seem to just be throwing a tantrum that they couldn't invest into BTC when it wasn't worth anything. Then there's also people who like to talk about shit that they don't know jack about. It really is the embodiment of the ""I don't know shit about fuck,"" meme combined with some ""If those kids could read they would be very angry.""

To address some of the points made by people against crypto.

***""Oh but crypto just puts power and control into a different hand, instead of the government.""***

Yes, **you**. Literally you control crypto, its value and the fluctuations, market circulation by using it. Crypto is entirely open. You can go read the code that you run on your own computer to join the blockchain network to make sure that no foul code has been added to break the system. Literally thousands of people do so on a daily basis which is what makes it so secure.

Governments have no safeguards or checks to ensure that they actually operate in our interests. [Inflation during the pandemic was five percent because governments care more about short-term economic revival than long-term sustainability.](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/what-is-inflation-is-there-economic-crisis-485642/)

Blockchains for larger cryptocurrencies such as the Bitcoin network run on millions of machines already. For a hacker to steal or add money they would need to affect at least 50% of every node in this setup. With traditional banks and currencies we're giving institutions and governments a ton of say in our own holdings and essentially providing them with ownership unless you're holding a physical asset like gold or an estate.

***""Crypto will make it easier for rich people to get even richer, and conduct shady business.""***

As I alluded to earlier, cryptocurrencies run on blockchains that are held by millions of people on the world. Joining the network is easy, and you can take a look at the ledger of BTC, SOL, XMR, ETH, etc. easily to see what the movements look like.

During the COVID-19 pandemic a lot of millionaires and billionaires made their riches by transferring their assets to safer investments knowing that the economy would be hit hard during this time. In a world running on crypto it would be impossible to hide such large movements, and one could even create bots to use this transparency to monitor the global financial market in a way that evens the playing field for people that aren't connected to those circles.

Not to mention, while crypto can be anonymous, most of them aren't and it isn't hidden behind any locked doors. It's incredibly easy to find out who the owner of most crypto-wallets are. There are only a few exceptions of privacy oriented wallets such as XMR but those have a different use-case that is by far less shady than what we currently have with financial institutions such as banks and investment firms.

***""Crypto is a scam! I've seen countless breaches and ponzi schemes.""***

Scams exist right now, too. All it takes is a shitty website disguised as a bank or online retailer to get your account information and steal thousands of dollars. This happens pretty much every minute to thousands of people across the globe. Crypto is no different. In fact, I'd argue that people who take crypto seriously, inform themselves before getting into it also get better at IT security and protecting their passwords, accounts, and files, due to the slightly steeper learning curve for getting into crypto compared to other assets and its technical nature.

***""Crypto will enable the rich to get richer and further increase the wealth gap.""***

The rich are already way ahead of us. But crypto doesn't make this worse, and if anything this sounds like an argument to invest IMHO. I'm not saying anyone should buy crypto, that's not the point of this post at all. But it's just not an issue that crypto is creating or making worse, even. It's a different asset to invest in, and thanks to its transparency at least we can monitor large wallets to understand what the wealthy people are doing if we're so convinced that they know something we don't. With traditional assets you have no idea whatsoever about what's going on and who is preparing for the next doomsday.

***""Crypto is bad for the environment, and takes away clean energy that could be used elsewhere.""***

This would have been true at the start of the crypto and in particular, Bitcoin, mining phase. People were spending insane amounts of money on mining farms, GPUs, wasting energy and such, but things have changed.

First of all, [Bitcoin mining, while still a thing, is running on nearly 60% green energy, a number that's only increasing.](https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/use-of-green-energy-in-bitcoin-mining-jumped-to-56-in-june-quarter-report-11625212165534.html) That makes it one of the main industries that primarily relies on clean power sources and is on a trajectory of becoming carbon neutral, while many other applications that waste a lot more power are still stuck on coal and nuclear energy. Not only that, Bitcoin mining actually gets most of its energy from excess produced in countries such as Iceland which means no one is being denied renewable energy since no one actually seems to care to use it except miners.

Second point. Bitcoin mining is one of the few wasteful consensus strategies still being used at a larger scale. Other, more modern currencies, such as SOL, XMR, ETH, DOT, etc. use proof of stake mechanisms to validate transactions, which can be ran with very little energy and actually still are profitable for retail investors. Bitcoin mining is only profitable if you run ASICS in a large server farm and have cheap energy and infrastructure fees.

There are cryptos that still run on proof of work validation mechanisms, or even some more exotic file-based ones that ruin hard drives. But as someone that invests into crypto with the future in mind, I doubt that people will be taking those seriously for the long-term when they're already released with a disadvantage to their core systems.

***""Crypto is only used for investing and trading, it will never be a real currency.""***

That's literally your fault, though. If you buy crypto just to hodl it for a year and leave, then you're part of the problem. There's evidence that wallets made within the previous 90 days will quickly sell when the crypto market starts dipping. Any wallets that exist longer than that seem to hold on to their assets for ages because they genuinely believe in crypto being the next big thing.

I know of far more people that see crypto as a currency they want to use in the future as a proper replacement for fiat. Stores online already offer incentives for using BTC, Tesla even accepts it as a payment method, while Twitter is adding it for their rewards scheme. Even Reddit now has a token on the Ethereum network to handle their premium memberships and community rewards. Check out the Reddit vault if you haven't yet. For mobile users it's in the side menu below your settings and profile menu options. The underlying blockchain technology used by crypto can be used for even more decentralized apps, such as content sharing networks, Solana already has dapps designed for artists, while DAAG is working on their decentralized stock exchange network on Solana as well, and the potential is nearly limitless.

So yeah, as I said. I don't want anyone to use this post as an incentive to buy crypto. I'm not saying you should. But please, inform yourself if you are going to criticize it, and use valid point. Crypto is a polarizing topic, so a lot of misinformation is spread on a daily basis and headlines are designed to infuriate some while exciting others. That's just how the news works. But crypto has a technical nature, which makes it easy to examine with an objective point of view. Make use of that and start making informed decisions about your finances instead of getting angry at the system and not doing anything about it.

It turns out that many other people usually share the same opinion, and the channel ends up exploding. I usually get it right.

I beleive it is because they have the x-factor. Something about the concept is different and special. When they have the x-factor it is almost inevitable that luck will find its way. You can just feel it.

So the lesson here is that if you have a strong enough concept, or are really good at something, eventually luck will find you. I beleive that.

75,qovkai,Spanish has a better system for naming millions (and powers of millions),Scribbles_,1636312527.0,5,0.67,8,"For those unaware:


Number (thousands)|Number (millions)| English | Spanish (trans.)
---|---|---|----
1000 |1M^0.5| Thousand| Mil (Thousand)
1000^2|1M| Million | Millón (Million)
1000^3 |1M^1.5| Billion | Mil Millones (Thousand Million)
1000^4 |1M^2| Trillion | Billón (Billion)
1000^5 |1M^2.5| Quadrillion | Mill Billones (Thousand Billion)
1000^6 |1M^3| Quintillion | Trillón (Trillion)

Etc.

Why is this better? The Spanish system makes logarithmic sense.

Millions are named with a system with a Latin ordinal prefix (bi-,tri-,quadri-,quinti-) and -illion. (with million being the unit and having no prefix)

That makes a million a 1-illion, a billion a 2-illion, and so on.

Now in English, each -illion represents an increase in an order of one thousand. But this makes 1000 be 0-illion. That means that an -illion is defined as the order of thousands minus 1. That is, a quintillion (5-illion) is 1000^6 .

In Spanish, each -illion  represents an order of one million exactly. This makes 1000 to be 0.5-illion (and say, a thousand million is 1.5-illion). A quintillion (5-illion) is 1M^5 . A thousand billion (2.5-illion) is 1M^2.5 .

This means the Spanish system has a more parsimonious naming rule and is a better representation of the numbers it describes. While odd-numbered powers of a thousand will have longer names, you need half the amount of words to describe powers of a thousand beyond a billion.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177172E5B70>

24 degrees is nice. 25 is too hot. 23 is chilly. You can't run Air conditioning properly. Also kg is just weird. It's too big. A lose of around 10 pounds only comes out to 3 kg.

You could even call it a conspiracy theory, it’s propped up on evidence that is easily disproven from more extensive, comprehensive and non-partisan studies.

The most ironic part of the movements IMO is that most supporters want guns gone through passing authoritative legislation to ban guns. So you:

1: Want to arm more criminals per capita (since laws only apply to law-abiding citizens, and gun legislation to disarm criminals is inherently an oxymoron)

2: Want officers less capable of handling firearm situations in real time (with or without more gun legislation), since less funding = less officer capability and quantity.

3: Let’s say scenario 1 doesn’t happen for the sake of argument, and we get all guns from the citizenry, legal or illegal: Want to take guns from regular people, so that police have even more leverage in real-time scenarios? When supposedly ACAB? That’s entirely backwards logic.

121,qjqzyc,"Disdain for, refusing to help the weak or cognitively unskilled is ableism.",filrabat,1635691596.0,11,0.66,22,"People have this attitude not because these traits signal a deliberate effort to non-defensively hurt others, but simply because they're deemed irritating, annoying or otherwise inconvenient traits. The sentiment penalizes someone for matters very difficult, and in the short term practically impossible, to manage. It's akin to blaming somebody with a broken leg (or not a natural sprinter) for being unable to run well, if at all.  This remains true even if they do not choose to ""wallow"" in it, or even ""wallow"" in it due to discouragement at ever finding the 'magic forumla' for self-repair.

Even if it's not due to a cognitive disability of some sort, they may also have certain deeply-held, even unconscious, ideas that spin the way they take and interpret outside information.  All the scorn and ridicule in the world is not going to eliminate that way of thinking.  The better approaches are to either have a respectful back-and-forth conversation with them while not disdaining any answers they give to why they think or react the way they do, no matter how off-the-wall or disgraceful, or suggest they see a cognitive psychologist about the matter.

Furthermore, seeing such people as ""not worth the trouble"" actually perpetuates the very problem so many people disdain. Thus, throwing such people under the bus can (ironically) cost society high quality talent. Their deficits don't negate their actual in-born talents in other areas, even if bad experiences inhibit development of those talents. This is especially true if they already show at least job-quality competence or praiseworthiness in certain areas society values highly (economic, cultural, humanitarian).

In summary, disdaining and especially refusing to help (i.e. so-called ""coddling the person"") is like somebody slamming a sledgehammer into a stalled-out car's engine because that person's irritated that the car won't run, even though expensive but still worthwhile repairs might make the car driveable.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177189EB470>

I'm not saying the CEO is a saint, but I think overall the good that he did by creating and leading Amazon overweighs the negatives.

Some positives:

* Pioneered cloud computing almost a decade before any of the other tech giants (Google, Microsoft)... Which has allowed other companies (Reddit) to grow and scale to where they are today.
* Reduced the total carbon foot print of the US. It’s a lot cheaper for a neighborhood to order online rather than each person drive a 2-ton vehicle across the earth every-time they need to buy a carton of milk. It's cheaper for Reddit to rely on AWS than build their own data-centers. Amazon is also on track to run entirely on clean energy by 2025.
* Has given people a lot of their time back that they would’ve had to spend running errands like grocery shopping. That extra 3-4 hours saved every week and reinvested wisely can compound into something life changing for a lot of people.
* Has employed over 1.5 million people with a company-wide minimum wage of $18/hr and good health benefits. Amazon’s net profits in 2020 was around 21 billion dollars. They pay their employees 90 billion dollars in wages and other benefits.
* Yeah Amazon’s CEO has 180bn net worth. But by founding and spearheading Amazon, he also created \~1.6 trillion dollars worth of wealth for other people (Amazon’s total market cap is at 1.8 trillion dollars). A large portion of that wealth are in pension funds, 401Ks, and Universities.

Yes the guy didn't do everything by himself. But the thing is is that he was the one who created the company, invested the most into the company. And was there at the beginning when every action, decision and dollar invested was the most impactful.

The workers who were there at the beginning or *anyone on the planet* also had the option to become shareholders of the company as well. For every $10,000 that they had invested it would've been worth $2-3 billion today.

If they had chosen to do that, who did they exploit exactly?

You can extend this argument to all of the companies whose products that you use or rely on everyday... Apple, Microsoft, Google, Netflix etc... The founders are or were all billionaires. But their companies have helped provide value to people more than they have harmed people.

The average US citizen still enjoys a lifestyle that is far better than the majority of people on the planet today.

137,qh5zhg,I just fail to see how everyone bio mom/dad should have 100% rights in raising a kid,WaterDemonPhoenix,1635367024.0,1,0.54,5,"So there are many parts to it. A bio mom that puts the new born into the foster care system shouldn't be allowed to take the kid back. The kid should quickly be given to a family that want the kid for life. It's not good for kids to keep switching environments. We should do what's best for the kid, and I don't think the mom/dad getting the kid back is good for them. Yet everyone says that because of biology that these bio parents should have legal claim to the kid. 

People also say preventing people from having kids, whether through social pressure or other means is a bad thing. I don't feel sorry confining a serial killer in prison alone where he cannot reproduce. Similarly, I wouldn't see a problem if we had laws or policies that prevent unfit parents from having kids. For example, one child policy, or taxing people for every kid they have over the second. 

If we argue people should be able to decide our own life, I would agree. But the mentality isn't consistent. If people want the government to layoff how many kids we can have, then they should layoff on how kids are raised? It's either it's moral to let the government control your kids life, ie mandatory education (yes even homeschooled kids need to show they are progress) or the government is immoral for control. 

Also, lets say in a futuristic world we have a pill that makes you infertile. No side effect, nothing. The only way to go back to being fertile is an antidote that the government gives you an antidote so you can have kids. The unpopular opinion is people think it's creepy for the government to control your sex life. It's no different than sex work being regulated, and also I just don't see how it's creepy to prevent the harm that a child may face. 

I also don't see why it's so 'wrong' to say poor people shouldn't have kids. I'm broke, I'm not gonna have kids. It's as simple as that. If I were 16 and unable to raise a child, I should not consciously and knowingly have sex to have a kid just because I 'want' one. I know people say a lot of kids in poverty are because of lack of education and contraception. If you are so dumb you don't know that having sex could lead to a child, then I can agree. But if you know that, then it's on you that your kid is suffering, and you disgust me. Lack of contraception isn't an excuse from adults. 

Honestly, my biggest issue, and I've tried on changing my view subs and stuff, but I just fail to see why raising a kid is a right. People want kids isn't a good reason for it to be a 'right'. And people want makeup and jewelry and whatever. A kid isn't something that should be seen as 'I want, therefore I should get'. Don't get why everyone 'should' be allowed a kid.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017718F307B8>

I can understand some people's sentiment as relayed by those who don't want universal healthcare. It's just hard for me to understand why people think everything is black and white and if you don't want universal health care you should die or something. 

The hypocrisy shows when people say that anti vaxxers shouldn't receive treatment. Can you not see this feeling might apply to others such as smokers, obese people etc? Obesity is high in USA. Private healthcare (insurance) could theoretically have people paying different rates. If you got hospitalized once for lung failure because you smoke for example, your cost goes up.

If you had any diseases that was linked to lifestyle, it goes up. Or at least, I think if the doctor prescribes you something, exercise once a week at least (show proof, such as video) your rates stay the same. 

I'm just saying, for me it's a necessary sacrifice, but doesn't mean I have to be happy paying for people's poor choices. In before, but some people have conditions that can't be helped. Yes, and it could be me, that's why I say I prefer universal health care, it's not a risk I'm willing to take, but it's not hard to say some don't want to give out their pay check for a risk they might not get. Whatever their decisions, it's their choice whether they like it or not.

Some say its a bad thing. To those that do think so, nothing can be proposed except for something that violates the freedom of someone, it would decrease our societies trend towards more individual freedom.

There wasn't a lot of incels of yesteryear because women couldn't work. Thus the incels negatively correlated to the amount of freedom women have right now. So now what about people today? Men and women are free to pick whomever they want. If they turn their nose up in disapproval and stay single, it is their choice. To shame them for being single is in away sort of going against the idea of let people do whatever so long as it doesn't hurt others. 

My point isn't necessarily bad or good that incels are rising or not, but simply that if you value 'my freedoms' then that is the consequence of it. In my opinion, I don't see a problem with a rising amount of singles. now you must be thinking, more singles means more incels and possibly more violent people. 

But I think even if it were true that lots of incels turn violent, I think that can be fixed with you should go to jail if you hurt someone. Being lonely sucks, but I think (and I think this is the key unpopular part) no society needs to ensure you get the partner you want.

People are tripping over each other to circlejerk about the remorse the actor must feel, who is soon going to overcome this and return to being a millionaire celebrity. 

It's also worth noting that 

a) when you're handed a weapon, it's your responsibility to make certain it's safe, and 

b) the amount of negligence required for something like this to occur is immense, and that falls on everyone on set, including Baldwin. Most jurisdictions would have no issues charging a ""normal"" person in an accident like this.

Now you have these guys these days who  make it into this massive big deal (not just talking about INCELS here, but hopeless romantics, too) but it isn't. It fucking isn't a big deal. A relationship almost always develops naturally over time, starts with friendship. And it naturally progresses, this is 99% of relationships that ever happened or will happen in the future. It isn't a big deal and it isn't dramatic. And you don't have to try to get with someone it just happens. It just fucking happens. Can you understand what I'm saying?

It just happens naturally. 

Now as far as the whole idea that ugly people or average people can't get  a date, I call bullshit. I've seen it happen many times, average dude with a great personality gets a pretty girlfriend. Unattractive/not typically attractive guy attracts others through other ways, like having a great skill or intelligence, etc. etc. 

You know, one thing those guys don't do? Go around whining about how they can't get a date. You know how boring that is to listen to someone whining about that stuff? Considering they could be doing something about it instead? Who wants to put up with that?

I am willing to acknowledge someone with social anxiety and other issues, but they should be doing the best they can despite those issues. Because what the fuck else are they going to do, wallow in pity? Again, women don't like that, and neither do men btw.

So yeah, that's about it really. I put this as 'unpopular on reddit' not because there's a big INCEL population here (there isn't - not anymore as far as I know) but I read shit on here all the time on dating subs, and other subreddits like foreveralone where they just wallow in self-pity and it isn't even real what they believe. Like if they really had zero chance of ever getting a date, I'd think that'd be sad and they could be sad about it, but that isn't reality and it never will be. Nobody has zero chance besides people who aren't even trying. 

And here's one more thing, you really should be focusing on yourself since you clearly have issues unrelated to other people and women, like being socially awkward is one thing but having no self-esteem is a whole other deal and that's your thing to work on nobody elses.

I cannot understand the concept of *wanting* to own a gun. A gun's sole purpose is to kill. (Or, you could say injure, but essentially kill). That is its purpose. At the very least, it is used for destruction. The reason I struggle with understanding ""gun enthusiasts"" is because essentially, you're collecting/obsessing over a tool used to kill others. Though you hopefully will not have to kill anyone with it yourself, that is what it does.

I look at it as some twisted eventuality of us being granted the right to have them (in other words, of course at some point, having access to them, this was bound to happen), but at the end of the day, the idea that someone is so gung-ho about owning something with such a purpose is what feels off.

It’s just so tasty and enjoyable to me because of the texture the food gets throughout eating it. My favorite foods to do this too are crunchy ones since it goes from super crunchy to super soggy as it’s absorbed the milk. 

I write about this as it’s always seen as weird or just disgusting because it not defined as cereal. To me, it doesn’t matter all that matters is that you enjoy it and find it tasty or just pleasing. Just because you don’t like it doesn’t mean other people should t be allowed to like what they like.

Some of my favorites to do this with are baked chips( bbq is the best), chicken flavored soup mix, certain pretzels, rice cakes, popcorn, crackers, cheezits, crispy cheese hot pockets, pizza crusts(and cheese pizza since meat isn’t the best soaked), gold fish, waffles/pancakes, hot fries, (O)reos, EL Fudge, donuts and pretty much any crunchy snack I can fit in a bowl usually is a pretty good choice too.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001771A6B85C0>

When you watch ""straight"" porn you have 50/50 man and woman stimuli. And see a penis 100% of time.

If you were truly heterosexual, seeing a man would make you *less* aroused.

I've also heard the argument that people watch it to ""imagine they are the guy"" but that makes no sense. There is no situation in which you need to see another person for your imagination to work.

Men and women are no different in this aspect. But for some reason, I've seen men think they have some moral high ground over women's ideas of an attractive man. If a woman states that she wants a tall partner, she must be a shallow bitch and a terrible person.

So what if some women want a tall man. The same way weight is an indication of attraction for men, height is an indication of attraction for many women. Yet I’ve had heard men call women shallow bitchs and argue with them about wanting a tall guy and then turn around and claim that they don’t date fat women? Their argument was always that being fat shows your lifestyle and lack of restraint. As if that somehow made them more righteous.

Now I know what you're going to say ""It's unfair, a woman can lose weight, short men can't just grow some inches!"" No it's not unfair, both are physical standards. Do you honestly think attraction is determined by which traits can be changed?

And even if I were to agree, what do you want women to do? As far as I know, women can't simply change who they're attracted to. Should some women just pair up with men they don't feel attracted to, so things are fair?

i used to be a huge bill maher fan. i loved religulous and i loved his stand up. however, as a nerd, what maher said in his rant hit a little close to home with me because i am a nerd myself. i love comic books and i love to read and analyze them. i betcha that maher has never picked up a comic book in his life because if he had, he would be able to see the amount of effort and creativity that goes into a comic book. and he can just fuck right off with that bit about how comic books can\`t be deep. seriously. there are many examples of deep comic books. watchmen, the sandman, kingdom come, etc. it\`s perfectly fine for him to not care for the medium but that doesn\`t give him the right to disparage people who do and to say that they should die(his words, not mine. ""i\`m not happy stan lee is dead. i\`m sad you\`re alive""). not only that he got super defensive in regards to kevin smith, his followers, and marvel(rightfully) calling him out for his disrespectful attitude. bill maher may not have disrespected stan lee but he did disrespect HIS ENTIRE BODY OF WORK. i know this sounds stupid but i can\`t help but feel that maher was personally attacking me just because i don\`t fight his idea of what an adult should be. yes i like comics and anime but i don\`t let it interfere with living my life. i act my age, i work a job, i go out with friends. i am a perfectly normal person who just so happens to like comics. but according to maher, i\`m a immature child and i deserve to die. i don\`t know what was worse. the fact that he was looking for validation for his asshole attitude...or that he was FUCKING GETTING IT! if you watch the clip, the audience is rolling in the isle and even applauding at times. APPLAUDING!!!! shit like that just reminds me of how many assholes exist in the world.

not gonna lie. after i watched the clip, i got quite teary eyed. i rarely get my feelings hurt nowadays but that got me right in the heart. this has shown me who bill maher truly is. he is not a hilarious comedian and social commentator. he is a bully. plain and fucking simple. he is a bully. if someone doesn\`t conform to his idea of a person, then he rips those people to shreds. he uses tragedies as an excuse to promote his own agendas. he is an asshole. quite frankly, i\`m surprised that his show didn\`t get cancelled after he wished DEATH on comic book fans. if i were the head of HBO, i would have forced him to apologize, after which i would have ended his show and removed all traces of it from HBO.

bill maher, congratulations. you just lost a fan. i hope your little rant was worth it. may you never breed sir. god forbid your children become nerds.

EDIT: ok, so it\`s the day after i posted this and i\`ve calmed down significantly. i am still kinda mad but my emotions were fresh when i posted this. you guys did make some very good points about how me wanting to cancel just because he has a different opinion then me is wrong. i do admit that what i said was wrong and it actually goes against my own principals.

i am still angry and offended by maher and i do intend to never support him again but i no longer want to cancel him. instead, i\`m just going to live my life the way I want to. i\`m going to continue to read comics and just be geeky because that\`s who i truly am at heart. and i don\`t give a shit if bill maher doesn\`t like me. i have lots of people in my life who DO like me for who i am.

The problem for me is that it is just focused on 1 characteristic.

Why not call it characteristic shaming? Why not apply it to age, bald men, short men, small penis, etc.?

If you make fun of a girl being fat you get crucified, however you can make small dick jokes all you want and shame guys for having a small danger, and no one will care.

Why the double Standards? That is what I do not agree. They act like fat women suffer more than x. But who are you to say that?

If you are going to apply to one group of people, why not apply the concept to all groups?

The moral should be: you should not shame people for their physical appearance. Not ""you should not shame exlusively fat women"". We should apply the concept, NOT the example.

It reminds of a South park episode, where Cartman got AIDS because it was the cool disease. But then it stopped being and cancer became the new cool disease and he lost all attention.

We should focus on the concept not on the example.
