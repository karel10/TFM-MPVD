The fact of the matter is the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while horrible and unjustified, was provoked by NATO expansion towards its borders.

9,tnn6x3,i`d be completely down for a black batman,herequeerandgreat,1648218627.0,0,0.48,11,"over the years, there have been many actors that people have thought would be really good batmen. jon hamm, luke evans, jake gyllenhaal, justin theorux, and others(if this was in the 2010s, i would have also listed armie hammer but...yeah no).

however, one thing I've noticed is that black actors constantly get the shaft when it comes to this stuff. and that\`s a pity because i would not only be ok with a black batman but i dare say I'd probably be all for it.

there have been black people who have taken on the mantle of batman in the comics so the idea of a black batman is not a new concept. I'm surprised that there have not been any black depictions of batman in any form. like, not just movies but tv shows. i am of the opinion that representation matters and, when handled well, can be really good. 

my guess is that people are worried that the film will turn into a woke mess. well, it doesn\`t have to. Bruce Wayne's race doesn\`t need to be brought up at all. he can just be black and...that\`s it. the film can otherwise be a perfectly normal batman movie. maybe some of the other characters would be black as well but it wouldn\`t be absolutely required(though, can we please get keith david as commissioner gordan and ving rhames as bane).

what actor do i have in mind to play a black batman? do i even need to say his name? idris fucking elba. he\`s a popular choice to play james bond but i think he would also make a really good batman. in my humble opinion, he is one of the best actors currently working and steals the show in every movie he\`s in. he was even one of the things i really liked about Prometheus, a film that i really do not care for. plus, the dude is an uber badass of the highest caliber. can you imagine him in the batsuit?

11,tmh7vl,7/10 is a valid ‘average’ and you can’t persuade me otherwise,the_turt,1648135841.0,2,0.55,15,"Everyone assumes that 5/10 or 7/10 is a valid form of average, and also assumes that the other is wrong. Personally, I disagree. I think both are right

You see, imagine if we are exchanging our thoughts on a book, and the book is neither good nor bad. Some would say 7/10, and some would say 5/10. I believe that the latter is correct, because weather it has 100 bad things and 100 good things, or has 1 good thing and 1 bad thing, it is still in the middle. Anything above 5/10 would mean the good things outweigh the bad things. It doesn’t matter how much, but if the good things weigh more, then it’s above 5/10. 

Now, you may be wondering why I chose to comment on this. My reason is because people are saying 7/10 is not average in any way, however I disagree. I think it’s the average of all good things. Think about it. A 6/10 means that the good things, while very small, do slightly outweigh the bad things. A 7/10, however, means that the good things significantly outweigh the bad things, though there could be significant improvements. (As you go up the rankings the improvements become smaller and smaller). If something is ok, not bab, but pretty ok, then it’s average inside the good side. The same goes for the bad side. A 3/10 is pretty average for the bad side (it’s bad, but not that bad). 

TLDR: 5/10 is average for everything, and a 7/10 is average for good things.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017704317AC8>
12,tluvp5,I'd be fine dating a woman who does Onlyfans,JLGoodwin1990,1648088161.0,0,0.46,11,"Personally, I never got what the entire fuss was about with it. You hear other men often say similar things. ""I would never in my life date, or even have a casual relationship with a chick who does, or ever has done OnlyFans"". They act like the woman has been tainted or is somehow less for it. Personally, I find that equal parts ridiculous, immature, and frankly screwed up. It's something similar like how some men take issue with how many partners a woman's had, sexual wise, which is also beyond stupid. They're not simply like slabs of meat, to marked and thrown in the garbage because they're considered ""used up"" or ""damaged goods"". They're human freaking beings, and thinking that way reveals how narrow minded and shallow a person is.

The things that should matter, whether you are simply having a casual, friends with benefits thing with a chick, or going above that to date, the only questions you should ask in my personal opinion, should be these. Do I get along with this person? Do we feel safe and happy with one another? Do we share mutual interests, and attraction with each other? And do we make each other's lives better? If the answer to those is yes, pretty much nothing else should matter. So what, people, mostly guys, pay to talk to her and see photgraphs and videos of her? That's a similar situation to the women who model for lingerie and dirty magazines. The key takeaway is this. That is literally all they can do, is talk and stare at their screens. They're not the ones that the chick chooses to let into her bed at night, or into her life. You are. That counts for something, majorly so. 

If I find myself attracted to a woman, if I think she's cool and she can make me laugh and vice versa, and we both find each other interesting, make each other's lives better by the other's prescence and we get along, and of course she's clean from STDs, that's all I care about. I will either date her, or have a casual friends with benefits thing with her, depending on what either of us want out of each other. So, she found a way to make some extra money, and it just so happens to be from her body. That's her choice, and as long as I'm not getting cheated on, I could give a toss less, in fact, I'll support her. If she wants to stop, she's had enough, same thing. And the same goes if she has stuff on it from things she did with past partners. That's the past, and it shouldn't matter if you're not seriously insecure. I don't give a damm what anyone else may think, or the high school like insults and insinuations they may throw my way for it. I'm happily long past the stage of caring about what public perception of me is.

Instead, all people, regardless of gender or biology, should be competing against each other, because, really, we are all the same deep down, so, we should all have the right to compete together. This is unquestionably the most inclusive and equitable route to go and will ensure that no longer are there debates about this league or that league and who competes in whichever one. It is all about competing as a human. And let's admit it, gendered sports leagues have always been sexist and a way to separate and discriminate... part of an antiquated patriarchical system of oppression and marginalization.

24,tjzovy,Ukraine should surrender,IronMaidenNomad,1647944033.0,6,0.64,10,"There was a post about this in the beginning of march, but the situation in Ukraine has changed since then, and I feel this still is an unpopular opinion.

As of now, Russia has taken a majority of the Donbas, and large swaths of southern and northern Ukraine. Mariupol is encircled, Kharkiv and Kiev are almost encircled. I believe these cities will fall in the coming months. If you look at maps of the war, every day, the Russians seem to advance. Not as fast as the Americans did in desert storm, but they are consistently taking Ukraine, piece by piece.

To me, their defeat seems inevitable. Russia has better equipment, air superiority, more Tanks, more soldiers, and as one would expect, they are winning.

Nonetheless, I'm not sure when Ukraine will surrender. Zelensky, and the Ukrainians I know of, seem determined to fight on. The westerners I know very much support them in this. The media keeps praising the Ukrainian war effort.

Just yesterday, Ukraine refused to surrender Mariupol. There still ate hundreds of thousands of civilians there. Encircled, hundreds of miles away from Ukrainian lines. Don't be deluded, there is no relief coming. The only thing the Ukrainians could hope for, is to keep a few Russian regiments busy for a few weeks, while the city gets destroyed, and thousands die pointlessly.

If the Ukrainians keep going down this road, they will repeat Mariupol in Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million, and Kiev, a city of more than 3 million. Hundreds of thousands may die, for the sake of making the war last just a few more months.

What is the point of this? The Russians have already offered pretty lenient peace terms. Ukrainian neutrality and secession of the Donbass and Crimea. If the Zelensky accepted this peace deal, he might save hundreds of thousands. Yet we westerners continue cheering the Ukrainians on, in their unwinnable fight, to throw away as many young men's lives as they can.

I'm not saying, that Russia should ever have invaded. It is evil to start such a war. But it also is wrong not to end such a war when you can. The Ukrainians should surrender, and we should stop cheering them on",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177044B9198>

You can't have it both ways.,occasionaldrinker,1647929028.0,16,0.69,30,"Property taxes landlords pay for their homes are the only reoccurring tax that exists for any private property. Every year after you buy a home you are taxed. When you buy a car you are only taxed once. When you buy a power drill you are only taxed once. When you buy a pack of beer you are only taxed once. When you buy a big purple dildo for bedroom usage you are only taxed once.

Imagine going to McDonalds and buying a cheeseburger for lunch and eating it and every year for the rest of your life you were taxed for the cost of that single cheeseburger you bought on March 22 2022. Property taxes are theft. You never truly own your property. The government does. Property taxes are the number 1 reason why rents are so high. The owner of the property needs to cover those costs and they raise rents.

Next up are the HOA's. I know most (probably around 90%) of international users of this site are in the UK, Canada, Australia or Mexico. I do not know if you have HOA's in your countries. In the United States HOA's are legal cartels. If you buy a home designated as an in an HOA neighborhood they can fine you for not cutting the grass on time, for parking a car outside of a garage or flying the flag at half staff during national tragedies (a tradition that exists in USA don't know about other countries). If you don't pay the fines they can put a lien on your home and steal your property without any compensation to you. That is pure fascism. The same kind of behavior you would expect from dictators. All happening in a supposedly ""free country"".

HOA neighborhoods are more expensive because you have to pay monthly fees in addition to the Maoist/Hitelrian/Stalinist fines for not doing what THEY demand for YOUR property.

Why does it matter if religious people are people? I don't think there is any evidence to suggest there is a god and I find faith not a reliable path to truth. I do think this mentality would hinder people. 

People of different cultures are human, but doesn't mean I like them. And I think the argument gets even more nonsensical when they say 'they want the same thing as you'.  do they? Does the culture of a pro blasphemy is illegal country really want the same as an American who is more anti banning speech? 

That's not to say that outliers don't exist, but to say there's no reason to point out cultures is just nonsense. 
Like if you point out India has a culture where spices is more used in their common dishes than Norway, why then can it not be said for other things. I can point out the large percentage of those against homosexuality in country x and those that support in country y.

I think all the amateur philosophers, nihilists, atheists, anarchists, psychologists, political scientists, on reddit should read the Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky for two reasons.

First, you'll see that none of your ideas are new or original. Reddit seems to think that history and philosophy didn't exist until the internet. You guys spout this nonsense as if you think you invented it. Read the Brother Karamazov and you'll see that almost nothing you see on reddit is novel. Human beings have been having the same ""I'm 14 and this is deep"" rants for at least 140 years.

Hitler thought he was in the right and he was as morally depraved as you can get.

A good villain should contrast against the hero in interesting ways and stand as an obstacle to the goals of the hero, all a morally Grey villain does is make the story more complicated and add layers of ""meta"" to the story.

I was not oppressed by men when I decided not to pursue a career in math. There are many things that could have came to play. None of them was 'a man told me I was a bitch for studying math'. Is it possible some people experience it? Yes. However you can say all of it is the sole factor. There is evidence that suggest that women get more anxious than men because of hormones. Math makes me anxious. I want a nice fun job. Again, of course people are different. The point however is, when you make claims about oppression, are you looking at how they got to where they are? 

Why are we obsessed with saying women are oppressed because they didn't get into tech companies? Are women oppressed if they don't do construction? Are men oppressed for not being in child care?

Are men oppressed because they don't get child custody or is it because of the 'culture of men'. Were these men the one staying at home with their child? Did they insist to be involved in the child's live?


Some people ask why some are poor and others are not. Kentucky is one of the poorest us state with an average black population, so it's not 'white man oppress Kentucky because they hate dem blacks'. And yet it also isn't because of 'outsider oppressing Kentucky'. The Amish are not educationally well of not because people on the outside hate them but because their own people are well... Keeping them in.
Well white people can treat native americans like shit, the alcoholism, the rape etc is not because of white men. It's native men abusing native women. and yet people wonder why some minorities would date outside their race and blame it on 'white man brainwash'. 

Is the NBA oppressing other people for not admitting non blacks? Or do people who are not black just don't feel like playing ball? 

Its unpopular but a lot of groups, be it states or not, vote for things that are bad for them or support things that are bad for them and blame outsiders. 

So ask why this group or that group correlates to poverty or no higher education. What were they doing? Did they live in a culture that turned a blind eye to drug addicts? I'm sorry, was there some outsider forcing you to do drugs? No. Trailer groups, hippies, gangsters is usually someone in your demographic.

One specific thing that bothers me about people talking about JK Rowling and her transphobia is how they then seek to dig out things from Harry Potter to use as ammo against her in a vile way.

I want you to imagine a timeline where JK Rowling did nothing on Twitter. Would there be people talking about how Goblins apparently resemble caricatures of 'Jewish' people, just because they run a bank? Would their be discourse on the elves being slaves and names like Anthony Goldstein or Cho Chang? I don't really think so.

The new game involves a Goblin Uprising and some people are up in arms because they think it mirrors Jewish people and how they were oppressed. I have to say, ever since I read the books YEARS ago, not *once* did I EVER make a connection between Goblins and Jewish people or think they were the same *until* I went on Twitter and people were saying so. Then everyone started parroting it and it became a sort of 'fact' now that everyone knows it. It honestly feels like some form of gaslighting because I can't have a different opinon and just say 'thats just your interpretation'.

All this to fuel JK Rowling hate? It seems a bit pathetic. There are PLENTY of games with shallow 'uprising' systems or 2D enemies, but slapping them with a 'psst they're actually Jewish' to fuel outrage as if its a clandestine fact is underhanded. I know that [Jon Stewart himself](https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1478791577573199875?s=21) doesn't think it, and he's Jewish. The fact is that fantasy and real life so often draw from one other that it can be dangerous to have a definitive opinion like that. This has also happened to Attack on Titan in the past with Jewish things because of the symbolism.

Too often people are way too quick to assume connections, and if a person falls outside the status quo of 'goodness', you bet there will be people hunting for ways to tear you down at any point.

45,thh3ur,"Everyone virtue signals, people only complain about virtue signaling when it's about virtues they don't like.",Scribbles_,1647643098.0,50,0.68,71,"The favorite thought-terminating cliché of conservatives has been ""virtue signaling"" for quite some time now.

Let's quickly go over why it's a meaningless accusation, why the right is notorious for virtue signaling, and why what you call ""virtue signaling"" says a lot about you.

**1/ Everyone virtue signals. The accusation of virtue signaling is virtue signaling.**

Any publicly manifested moral position is a virtue signal. If you accuse someone of hypocrisy you are signaling that you hold moral consistency to be important. If you say people should stand up for the anthem, you are signaling that you care about patriotism. If you denounce people for caring too much about foreign problems, you are signaling how you are above caring for such things.

The outspoken position that virtue signaling as a bad thing is at best a way to signal that one thinks virtue signaling is wrong and at worst and implication that one is above virtue signaling.

Virtue signaling is morally neutral, it is a normal part of our conversations about morality and has been a facet of society for as long as we have records of moral discussions. People signal

**2/ The right loves virtue signaling.**

Protect the children! Salute the flag! I worked hard all my life! I don't listen to the mainstream media! I do my own research! I don't get easily offended!  

**3/ Accusations of virtue signaling say a lot about you.**

If we agree that everyone virtue signals, then the problem is not virtue signaling, it's the virtues being signaled.

The right wing loves virtue signaling of patriotism, but hates virtue signaling of anti-racism.

It loves virtue signaling about protecting the children, but hates virtue signaling about protecting war refugees.

It loves virtue signaling about not being easily offended, but is deeply offended at how people virtue signal through offense.

The right accuses people of virtue signaling only insofar as they are signaling for something the right hates, but they cannot admit they hate those things.

---

The point here is: ""virtue signaling' is just a way to not state some opinion outright. It is, like most accusations favored by right wingers, absolutely meaningless and self-defeating.

Reddit is only socially progressive, which is only a tiny part of actually being progressive. If you look at most comments on almost any political sub, redditors believe in a glorified past where things were better, more affordable, etc. 

Aside from wanting a “return to the past”, redditors are also very technologically and scientifically conservative. If you go to subs like r/technology or even r/futurology, the comments are mostly just people attacking every advance in technology. A good example is how Reddit is largely against life-extension, nuclear fusion, neuro-interface, etc. 

Because Reddit is only socially progressive, they only really ever advocate for fixing problems through social means instead of technological means. For example; instead of relying on better covid vaccines and covid antivirals, Redditors advocate for everyone to just wear masks everywhere. Instead of developing alternate green technology like Fusion, aerosol injection, and carbon capture along side renewables; Redditors advocate for only renewables and “economic degrowth”. Instead of developing better Sex-transition surgery; Redditors advocate for “abolishing the gender dichotomy”. And lastly, instead of curing aging, Reddit is vehemently against that because they want socially conservative old people to die out. 

Looking at Reddit’s views on Social Issues and saying this is what makes Reddit progressive is extremely narrow. When you look at the whole of what it means to be “progressive”, Reddit is hardly different from conservatives.

I WAS JUST REPORTED AS A POTENTIAL RAPIST ON THE r/unpopularopinion SUB BY THE MODS BECAUSE THEY MISINTERPRETED THE MESSAGE. I WAS SIMPLY POINTING OUT THE LOGICAL FLAW WITH THIS POLICY, AND THAT OPINION IS UNPOPULAR. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With the war in that part of Eastern Europe, a sex discriminatory policy has come into effect regarding the draft in addition to men aged 18-60 being prevented from leaving the country. No such policies are being enacted on the women of the nation, and in fact there are polices to explicitly get women out of the country for their own safety. While people might say something along the lines of ""But its practical for the nation to do these things"", that same reasoning is also the reason for what I said in the title should be allowed.

The following is exclusively targeted to people who support the male only draft as well as restricted movement for males. I'm also not saying that this should be an enacted policy. I think the draft should apply to both men and women, and I'm just pointing out the logical conclusion the former leads to.

The primary reason for women being shielded from conflict isn't, as popular opinion seems to think, the fact that women aren't capable of fighting. Its reproductive asymmetry that is the main reason. The concept of a draft is to force a segment of the civilian policy to fight wars, often with minimal training due to the draft being made to supplement a professional army. In the same way women are less capable than men on average to fight, so are regular civilians being conscripted to fight in comparison to professional soldiers. With modern technology, specifically the advancements in firearms, children are fully capable of being used as soldiers if the many conflicts in Africa are to observed. Considering the situation that part of Eastern Europe is in, ever potential soldier they can get would be useful, yet women are still exempt. Its the reproductive asymmetry that matters.

In the modern context of what can still be applied to today, the average male has the biological capacity to impregnate dozens of females. Meanwhile the average female would probably be capped at 10 children, and that's assuming they are being used as a pseudo-baby factory from 18 years onwards. I don't think I have to explain the 8th grade anatomy as to why this is.

If the male only draft is being implemented because its more practical for the war, then pro-birthing policies would be made during or after the war itself to recuperate the lost population. When the dust is settled and if that place in Eastern Europe survives, the nation will need to rebuild, not just economically but by population as well. Countries have historically promoted policies that encourage higher birth-rates to replace the dead. Post WW2 USSR is a well known example. If men can be forced to undergo all of that, why should women get a free pass for footing their end of the bill? Why is war mandatory for men, but replacing the shrunken population, something that is in the interest of the nation which the male only draft was also made for, too much?

With this said, if you think that it is acceptable to force someone into a war they don't want to fight. To risk grievous bodily injury, death, or an extreme form of pain in one or both of those things. To fight for something that may not even believe in, and to trap them in the country in which this conflict is occurring, punishing those who do not obey, then rape is comparatively more acceptable. Is emotional trauma really worse than what I just described? PTSD exists, and I'm pretty sure that your average male civilian who is forced into this situation isn't going to be as mentally tough as regular soldiers, so PTSD rates will be higher.

In the interest of the nation, women should try and have as many kids as possible until the government says to stop. If you don't want to do this, then remember what happened to the men who refused to fight. What's your excuse for not contributing to the effort as you hopped on a train to safety, leaving your fellow citizens to potentially die, all while you do nothing? Rape isn't even the first answer. The government would probably just tell you to pick someone and go from there. Rape, obviously the kind that would impregnate them, would be the last possible action to be permitted against these women. Complain all you want about the 1900s, that was the time period and its not like life was a living hell for them. Back then, gender (or rather sexual) equality was ""Julie didn't get to go to university, while John didn't get to live"". All the progress that has been made so far. How many ""White Feather Girls"" would refuse service if they were the ones who are told to go to the frontlines to fight with the men? Gender equality means you suffer the same as men, just as much as you prosper. If men who refuse to fight are cowards, what are you? How privileged to you have to be to cry out at the first sign of pain, all while turning a blind eye to, even support the actions that cause pain to others.

If you are willing to make universal policies that divide people by characteristics they can't change, then don't act like you have the moral high ground when going by your actions.

I could go on and on about the immorality of the women who tout patriotism, encouraging the men to fight all the while they get off scot free, sounding like an incel in the process, but I digress. If you think this comparison is unfair, refer to what I have said already, but also this analogy. Would you be completely okay with some rich boy of fighting age saying:

""No, I shouldn't be expected to fight. I'm too rich and privileged to subject myself to possible harm. Instead the poor should risk death while I flee to safety, even though the job that I'm given is far less dangerous than the one that others get.""

At least in this example the rich person could just pay the government a certain amount, functionally being a draft dodge payment that contributes to the nation. What do the ladies specifically who are currently in places like Poland have to say about what they will contribute, and what should happen if they don't want to ""do their part""?

Again, this rant is about the logical extrapolation about certain policies, and I think the draft should apply to men and women, and that rape isn't the answer here.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017702F0BD30>

>""Ask any non-deranged parent if they want their six-year-old to talk about their sexuality with their teacher and they'll look at you like you're crazy,"" Alex Perez [wrote](https://spectatorworld.com/topic/democrats-desantis-florida-dont-say-gay-bill/) at *The Spectator World*.

The literal text of the bill which Leftists object to says:

""\[c\]lassroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on **sexual orientation** or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate.""

The bill doesn't say anything about forbidding teachers from discussing THE CHILD'S sexual orientation, just sexual orientation in general. As a concept. To me, a lesson on sexual orientation is as simple as, ""some people are gay, some people are straight."" This is just objective reality that children are going to be exposed to if they meet another child with two moms, or a teacher with a same sex partner. That's why Democrats are calling it the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill: because it literally says you can't instruct about sexual orientation. That's what ""gay"" is. Is it ""deranged"" to worry that gay people can't be acknowledged or talked about in a classroom? Are we saying a gay teacher can't talk about their spouse, but a straight teacher can? Or neither should be allowed to?

Am I missing something? The only argument I could envision from a Right wing proponent is ""well, sexual orientation in the bill doesn't mean *sexual orientation*, it means... blah blah blah."" But that's the same argument as ""defund the police doesn't mean defund the police"" which the Right hates. So how come the Right gets to take what Democrats say literally and criticize them for ""double-speak,"" but the Left are wrong to take the Right literally when they say ""don't teach about sexual orientation doesn't mean Don't Say Gay?""

If the bill is meant to restrict something other than lessons that gay people literally exist, why doesn't it say so? Conservatives are claiming it seeks to prevent grooming but it doesn't say that. It implies that teachers cannot teach even that gay people exist at all. And then why shouldn't we take it one step further? ""Straight"" is a sexual orientation. Should teachers be forbidden from acknowledging their opposite-sex partners as well? Should books with married couples be banned? Clearly Republicans don't mean that. But they spend so much time making fun of Democrat double-speak only to employ similar vague, doublespeak tactics here. 

It's clear that what Republicans want out of this bill is for teachers not to teach kids that they may be gay or trans. But by forbidding the discussion of these topics completely they create a kind of Streisand effect situation of gay now being a taboo thing you learn on the playground instead of the classroom, and risks creating a culture of shame and bullying against, say, the kid with two moms that the teacher isn't allowed to teach a lesson about. I don't think that's a ""deranged"" concern.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776D96F048>

62,tdbv16,The weapons lab theory is VASTLY dumber than MSM's Rittenhouse coverage,Experiment_93711b,1647192713.0,3,0.62,6,"The Rittenhouse case was a mask-off moment for most of the media on the left and showed how easily manipulated their viewers are. With just minimal effort they could have seen the raw footage of the unprovoked attacks on Kyle, the pedo shouting the n-word and death threats, and the flaming city.

However, the theory that US funded biological weapon research in Ukraine is even more idiotic, because you don't even have to do *any* fact checking at all. All it requires is minimal thinking because it's simply so dumb on its own. No further evidence required.

1. **First of all, let's look at this from the Russian perspective**. Why the hell would they initiate a slow, mass-murdering invasion with the intention of killing the guy with the finger on the button, giving him plenty of time to press it? Surely, they would have either exposed them before the invasion, staged a coup or made it their main priority to secure the weapons first.
2. **Secondly, there's the US perspective.** It makes absolutely no sense to fund biological weapons in an active warzone with major threat of exposure from not only the Russians, but also internal corruption and the ever-increasing EU integration. Build that shit in Alaska or make a deal with an allied dictatorship in stable conditions.
3. **Finally, you got the Ukrainian perspective.** If they actually had biological weapons or the credible threat of it, they could easily force the West to interfere if it wasn't enough to have Putin back down. The only reason we're not blasting Russians in Ukraine is due to a ridiculously small risk of a nuclear response. The threat from a man who's about to lose both his life and his country has FAR more impact.

The counter-argument that ""there are labs"" can be easily dismissed. Of course there are labs. There are labs in almost all countries. That's not the claim. The claim is that biological weapons were being developed for military purposes. Even if the development isn't finished (it never would be), the ""beta-versions"" would be plenty deadly and it wouldn't matter anyways because, all it takes is the credible threat which you'd have. And just having the program shows a willingness to use it.

I can still forgive people for being dumb enough to believe this. After all, the brain turns off easily when consuming media and tribalism takes over. However, there is no way the ""anti-mainstream"" media doesn't know what they're doing. Whether it's to milk the tribalism or because of actual Kremlin interference is irrelevant.

1. One of them, when it's in power, tends to expand social programs meant to help the poor, increase taxes for the rich,  etc.

2. The other one opposes that. They support flat taxes, and reducing these social programs. They also attempted to privatize public hospitals, but didn't manage to do it because of a corruption scandal that interrupted the plan. Their supporters and activists are openly very harsh towards poor people who get money from social programs. They call these people lazy and stupid.

The question is: which one of these parties is labeled as ""right wing""?

answer: The first one. 

My point is, the labels ""left"" and ""right"" when it comes to politics don't really have any consistent definitions. Their meaning changes depending on who's using them. They're literally useless in any kind of nuanced political analysis. They're mostly just used in simplistic ""us vs them"" statements, which means there's no actually good reason to use them.

""Don't hit on coworkers, it's unprofessional.""

""Leave them alone at the gym, they're trying to work out""

""Baristas/bartenders are only being nice to you because it's their job, stop hitting on them"".

There have been SO MANY great relationships that are a byproduct of doing just that. In fact, it's usually the common talking point when people bash dating apps - ""just go out and meet people, have you not been to the gym? People did fine before dating apps existed, I meet my wife/husband via a coffee shop transaction!""

I'm all for sending the message of 'no means no' and to not harass anyone - but saying ""don't even talk to them to begin with, they don't want to talk to you"" is sending the wrong message.

There was a post on AITA not too long ago that kind of rubbed me the wrong way - a guy was talking about how he was 'revoking an employee's opportunity because he was using it to hit on women'. Now of course being mainstream reddit he got mostly NTAs - but there were a few issues.

For one, the story never mentioned him harassing anyone or persisting after being told no - just shooting his shot and nothing else. I mean, if you're single and your work happens to give you an opportunity to meet people and you have to take an interest, then why the hell not?

But also what made the post even worse was that THE OP MENTIONED HE WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE WHO WORKED THERE. So obviously someone had to 'hit on' someone for that to happen. When I called him on that, his only argument was that ""she asked me out, I was keeping me distance"".

Okay so? Why do you give HER a pass for it? I mean that's a rhetorical question and we know why (I asked him that and he never responded), but it goes to show that sometimes it will have a positive result and you'll never know unless you try. No one was saying the OP has to be a wingman, but unless he gets a complaint then he doesn't need to make it his duty to cockblock.

Also you can't be psychic and know what the result will be. People are always saying ""it's okay to get rejected"" - but clearly it's NOT okay if you're apparently doing something wrong or committing an offense by shooting your shot to begin with - particularly committing an offense if the answer ends up being no. If the answer is yes though you're in the clear. So you basically need to be psychic, it seems.

That's one nice thing about dating apps, you don't have to worry about the ditzery of 'hitting on' - but really you should be getting out there and shooting your shot, even though many keep telling you not to. Just pretend there's a secret society where it's okay and encouraged and that the message is a test to see how timid you are - because that's basically what it is.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017703149400>

It seems like sexuality is a bit of a spectrum and its pretty rare to only be on the edge of one side. This is because I feel like that if most men were exposed to femboys or trans women they would actually somewhat enjoy it. Sure some of them would not like it because ""Ew its a person with a penis"" which is true but that being said a lot more men then you think would probably have sex with at least one of them. After all on reddit all you see is people talk about femboys and generally those people say they are straight. I have also had personal experiences regarding this. That personal experience was when I accidentally ran into trans porn when I was 13 and having sexual feelings with it. A week after that I was turned on by full on gay stuff which leads me to believe that sexuality is more maulabile then I might have thought. I don't think its nessericaly a choice and some people are just born straight or gay but I do think to some extent most people are born somewhat in the middle and more near the straight side. This is probably why the people that wrote the bible made homosexuality a sin due to the need for breeding during those times and them seeing homosexuality in themselves and feeling shame.

Unless they wore a ring I had no idea if they were married and even then unless their spouse showed up at work or something, I had no idea if they were gay or straight. I saw my teachers as just teachers, which is why if I saw them outside of school in “normal clothes” and acting different than in the classroom it was always a shock to the system.

Now-a-days teachers seem to be totally self-obsessed, narcissistic, and often acting like groomers.

 I will say right away this is obviously not true across the board, there are still teachers out there who stay objective and who are only focused on educating their students with an agenda.

If you have spent any time on social media you have probably seen how many teachers are exposing their students, children, to their sexuality, political beliefs, “gender identity”, and find ways to sprinkle that in anywhere they can. Because for them teaching is all about themselves, and many brag about how many LGBTQAI+ flags they have in the classroom.

Currently in Florida Democrats and teachers across the state are LOSING THEIR MINDS because they cannot talk to kindergartners through 3rd grade about sexuality and gender.  Let me repeat that, there are teachers in Florida who are furious that they can’t introduce kindergartners to sex and gender.

Kids should be focused on math, science, writing, reading, art, and other things that will benefit them later on in life and have no political leaning if done properly. There is no reason in the world you would feel the need to talk about sex or gender with children of that age unless you are doing it for yourself, because of your own untreated mental illness that i likely being enabled by those around you, or you want to groom children too young to do basic into asking questions and thinking about things they are incapable of comprehending. 

Not to mention all the teachers who actively force children to wear masks to “protect themselves” despite the significant damage it does to their ability to learn as well as cause all kinds of psychological issues like anxiety and depression. The vast majority of human communication is visual, we rely on facial expression and reading mouths at a young age a lot for everything from speech to identifying how someone is feeling or what they are thinking. 

 I miss the days when mentally unstable narcissists and groomers, who if they had these same sexual talks in front of a parent on the playground with a child would have the police called, weren’t allowed to teach or be around children.

Teaching should only be done by people who can remain objective, do not inject their dogmatic or perverted views into curriculum, and think a child’s innocence is something to be protected and not exploited.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177047C3A58>

I would never think of this as ""1nc3l"" content, but ironic that the appropriate subs for that kind of content are banned. I'm including this note because the whole situation fits very well with the theme of my unpopular opinion.)

I'll start with an anecdote.

My high school friends come back to town. ""Hey, let's hang out,"" they say. Then, after they're back home, ""Oh, sorry we didn't have time to hang out.""

Then you learn that they did hang out with some other people. People you knew in high school, but weren't very friendly with. Your friend, however, was more friendly with these people than you were. You would have been happy to hang out with them, neutrally as generic, professional adults catching up. But this third party wouldn't want you around. Why? Because they're elitist, arrogant, narrow-minded and petty. To everyone. They really are the common denominator. They exclude a lot of people, not just me.

So, in choosing who to prioritize, me and a couple of other people, or these arrogant people, my friend(s) choose the arrogant people. Then, they lie to me to spare feelings even though I'd obviously know. In other words, they're not actually sparing my feelings, they're avoiding accountability for their social choices and expecting me to bear the full burden of my disappointment caused by their choice. Let's consider why the exclusionary, arrogant person won. In a moment.

Now, a premise:

If you tell someone, ""Between one person and everyone else, who do you think is the problem, all of them, or just you?"" Who is the audience?

The Shunned Person

I'm arguing that the audience is a person who is probably beautiful but a little different. I'm arguing that people are usually willing to socially excluded and punish others for the smallest reasons, since socially acceptable shunning is not considered unethical. It is actually pretty unethical, but since ethics are socially enforced, disproportionate shunning is simply not seen as a problem. Psychologists talk about disproportionate thinking.

A person who is socially shunned might complain, ""Everyone hates me."" This very common attitude is met by psychologists who say, ""Do they really hate you?"" in an effort to return to proportionate thinking. So, this person will go investigate. Maybe ask people who seem more trustworthy and empathetic, ""Why did you shun me? Do you hate me."" The empathetic person is shocked, ""No, we don't hate you, not at all. Oh, sorry, we didn't think we were shunning you. Now that you put it that way I can see how what we did was pretty hurtful. Honestly, the vibe of the room was that a few people out of many were seemed a bit uncomfortable having you around, so we were trying to think of them.""

If you really want to learn something, press further, ""Well why do you think that person is uncomfortable? Would they have a good reason to feel that way?""

""I don't know, I can't think of one.""

""So, in that case, why did you defer to them so easily, when - now that you've thought about it - your actions hurt me so much?""

At this point, even a very empathetic person will grow at least a bit uncomfortable and not have much to say except to apologize and maybe even validate the shunned person, maybe invite them to things more proactively, but they will rarely ""go to bat"" for a person and try to push against the now prejudiced perceptions the group has. It's no their fault. These are how social dynamics work.

The Prick

Now let's say the nominal social assumption about, ""It's not everyone else, it's you,"" is correct. The person being told this is a narcissistic psychopath who believes everyone in the world owes them love and that what they do, their every breath and sentence, is precious and beautiful more amazing than what anyone else does. Trying to impose themselves on everyone, demanding affection, this person is shunned. Complaining about it, they have to be informed that yes, they are the problem, not everyone else.

How often does this actually happen?

The truth is that narcissistic personality types tend to be very socially adept. Being told, ""It's not everyone else, it's you,"" would be one of the single most devastating things a narcissist can hear, and they spend most of their energy and attention being deeply engaged socially in order to avoid it.

Narcissists do favors, give gifts and defer to the social cues of 80%, maybe 90% of the social environment. In most cases, they are widely liked and thought well of. They also target about 10% of the social environment as scapegoats. They use the social power they've earned through favors to turn the group against people who are easily shunned merely for standing out.

The shunned person may stand out for reasons that make them genuinely a bad fit for social life. Or, maybe the person is literally just superficially different.

In summary, the actual Prick-type will almost never expose themselves to social derision by violating social cues. They will however turn communities, rather consistently, against people just because they are noticeably different, and make and effort to shun them

""It's not everyone else, it's you"" is the ""G"" word related to lamps.

Socialization isn't merely people getting along having fun. There's competition for status. There's exclusion. There's sexual competition, which can get absolutely brutal and in some communities leads to actual violence.

Social rank, especially for very socially oriented people, is the difference between whether you have to sit there and put up with listening to someone's life saga and quietly validate, or whether they owe that to you. Social rank determines who decides what the group is doing for fun. Social rank determines access to sex. Social rank in the professional world determines access to opportunities.

When it comes to belief (religion or political ideology), social rank determines whose ego-invested belief system is validated or not.

Social rank matters, and it's no spring picnic.

It's more likely that people will be shunned because they threaten or confuse the social structure, then because they are individually a problem. Actual jerks are far more likely to be included or even elevated in the social structure - because they're important managers who are will to exclude and also enforce rank. At the very least, more jerks do well socially than there are jerks who are excluded for being jerks.

Reminding someone that they're a social failure, ""It's you, not them,"" will 9 times out of 10 not be directed to a villain who has deserved to be lonely and excluded. 9 times out of 10 it will be punishing and re-injuring an excluded person in order to protect the social structure, which ultimately actually protects bullies more than otherwise.

It's Toxic

What do people think they're accomplishing by saying, ""It's not everyone else, it's you.""

They're not showing empathy. They're not being generous. What good do they perceive they're doing? What is the purpose of them saying this.

I see it most often when a person is being critical of something that has genuinely harmed them. And then someone else, for whatever reason, feels the need to prioritize the group's freedom from accountability over the harm caused to an individual. That is toxic AF.

It Really Is Everyone Else

[https://nypost.com/2019/08/02/1-in-5-millennials-are-lonely-and-have-no-friends-survey/](https://nypost.com/2019/08/02/1-in-5-millennials-are-lonely-and-have-no-friends-survey/)

One in five millennials report having no friends. There's other off topic data about how relationships aren't working how they used to. Depression is certainly up.

Books have been written about rampant narcissism in the United States. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Culture\_of\_Narcissism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture_of_Narcissism)

People with foreign experience often remark about how cold and narcissistic American culture is.

This isn't like some nerd's whiny complaint about not being given free affection.

When my high school friends treat me that way - run out of time to see me because they prioritized other people, who could have invited me along but refuse to have me, and then I'm lied to because it has to all remain my problem - these are crap friends!! It sucks, because I'm generous enough to overlook it. I'm generous enough to overlook the arrogance of the third party, to not bring my idiosyncratic tastes to a friendly social reunion.

Generosity and openness don't have social cache. They do matter to individuals, but you'd be HARD press to convince even an empathetic person to take social risks on behalf of even someone whom they like.

The only reason my high school friends are still in contact with me is that they personally like me. They've chosen social environments that would have nothing to do with me, so if it was up to ""everyone else"", my high school friends would cut off contact.

If I'm the common denominator, I'm liked. It's why they still have some interest. If ""everyone else"" was the common denominator, I'd be cut off.

What we see is that, more often than not, ""everyone else"" really is the common denominator.

Because too many people, especially in American culture, simply will not risk their social standing for the sake of personal relationships, empathy or values.

That's definitely an ""everyone else"" problem, and in my opinion, people in America especially who won't admit that (for fear of appearing like a shunned person) are contributing to the problem in a big way.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770313DC50>

I support so called ‘cancel culture’, and I’ve heard nothing so far that has encouraged me to change my mind.

It’s mostly comedians coming out and complaining.

People say ‘we can’t even have a laugh anymore’. But what are they laughing at? Bigotry, that’s what. These people find racism something to chortle about. They find homophobia and transphobia to be hilarious. 
What is so funny about mocking minority groups? Why do people feel the need to make fun of people who already get treated like shit? 

I’m sure many of you will come at me with that ‘what about freedom of speech?’ crap. All I have to say about that is this: Fuck your free speech. If your free speech allows a white supremacist to stand on a dais in public, and throw around the N word, then that is wrong. End of.

My submission title is a little extreme, the alternative is that it should at the very least warn creators that they may not make any significant money. 

I speak from experience. I'm a glamour photographer who worked with a few girls and helped them set up their OnlyFans or Patreon pages. I only did this for girls who already had a decent following, as my projections were around at least 2-4k USD per month for them. Girl A with 180k followers on Instagram was earning around 6k per month after 3 months. Girl B was at around 350k followers, she was earning upwards of 12k per month after 3 months. 

In our social circle, other girls with Instagram accounts and the like noticed the money they were earning. So they signed up too. Almost nobody made any significant money, since they were all below 30k or 10k followers. 

I think it's important to limit accounts due to how our society currently is. Your personal and/or professional life could be seriously crippled if you upload any pornographic content. It simply isn't worth the risk, unless you're completely sure about it, and you know it'll provide a comfortable income. 

Additionally, I don't think this type of work should be glamourized due to the increased danger it adds to your personal life. Someone I worked with in the US had a crazy stalker show up at her house armed with a gun. Wanted to kill her, failed to find her. Got gunned down by the cops as he attempted to flee in his car.

One of the more intriguing crimes on the books to me is ""possession of burglar's tools"", because there actually are no tools specific to burglary.  The tools that burglars use are just construction tools like hammers, crowbars, cutters, etc that can be found in sheds, garages, vans, pickup trucks, etc all over the country.  But given the right set of circumstances, (ie. clear intent to commit a crime), these same tools become illegal, because we really don't want to wait for a place to be broken into before we are able to prosecute someone.

In our political system, the supreme court is the safeguard against the President issuing illegal executive orders and Congress passing unconstitutional laws.  It's the equivalent of having a fence around your yard and a lock on your door to protect your property, except with the supreme court they're protecting something much more precious - your political and civil rights.

So if a political party is arguing that the supreme court not only needs to be expanded, but expanded in such a way to give themselves an immediate majority that would take decades of fair elections to overturn, then that's the political equivalent of a guy coming to the back door of your house late at night with a crowbar.  Sure, it's possible that they're a construction worker that's there to do some repairs, but it's much more likely that they are there to jack your stuff and hurt whomever gets in the way.

If we're going to exclude dictators from the global financial system - which by the way we almost never do, look at China, Saudi Arabia, etc  - then what do you do with a political party that is trying to remove the democratic and constitutional safeguards?

These critics would always go on about how we don't need such a military in the modern world of today, that it serves no purpose and that no such situation could arise where a military such as America kept on hand would be necessary. They would then point to Europe and say ""SEEE, these European countries barely have any military any longer and put a small fraction of resources into military compared to the US.

However, with the situation now in Ukraine, where we are looking down the barrel of a situation where you have Russia invading Ukraine, an action that is backed by China, it is suddenly becoming apparent that this situation could expand to a level and scope that expanded well beyond Ukraine and potentially into the rest of Europe. With such a situation rearing its ugly head, I would imagine at this point all of those critics who laughed at the US for keeping such a large well-funded military must feel quite foolish now, especially those Europeans who would constantly mock the US about its military, as, if things do indeed fall apart in Europe and Russian tanks start rolling west, Europeans will unquestionably have to rely on American might in order to fend off such an attack, as most European countries sit nearly defenseless themselves against such an onslaught.

If leftists had got their way over the last several decades in the post-Cold War era, who desperately wanted the US to reign in its military size and funding and keep only a small military presence akin to what Europe does, no doubt the West would have no defense at all against any potential land war that we seem to be looking at the possibility of at this very moment. So, to all those who much such ill-informed statements over the years, I hope you all feel quite foolish now, because, like I said, if things in Europe deteriorate even further and Russia begins to charge west across Europe with the backing of China, the US will be the only thing to defend against such an action, so, I hope all those critics I mentioned above feel quite foolish now.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017702E12C50>

1. They're stubborn and/or delusional

104,t7mn01,"People have been incorrectly abusing the term ""friendzone"" for the last decade to the point that it collectively shifted meaning. Here's what it actually means.",i_like_it_eilat,1646525953.0,0,0.5,8,"It's also probably why it has the stigma of 'entitlement' - because everyone these days seems to believe it's synonymous with 'unreciprocated feelings' and nothing more. It's not.

It's also not a verb, it's not a thing people voluntarily 'do' to people on their volition, and in fact seeing incels use it like that is annoying and I can understand why it gets the negative rap it does.

But what it actually means (or at least originally) - is the concept that *a close friendship with someone is the -reason- they don't see you as dating material*, because you're 'too close to home' for them such that somehow intimacy would be weird and feel like incest.

Hence ""zone"" - a specific point where their closeness is somehow mutually exclusive to the other kind of closeness. Or just straight up the idea that friendship in general is mutually exclusive to intimacy. And yes, as dumb as that sounds, that's what it means.


So, these days when someone is rejected by someone they recently met, it's silly and wrong to say that they were ""friendzoned"" or ""in their friendzone"" - because there was never a friendship to be had to begin with, they barely know them.

Now, whether that's actually a thing and the people in question actually do have people they feel that way about, is up for debate - since it could just be that they're simply not into them regardless and it has nothing to do with their 'friendship'.

But whether it's true or not, generally the idea is that being friends with someone is what's primarily contributing to hurting the possibility of being seen as date material. Or in simpler terms, the idea that an *existing friendship* is somehow a dealbreaker.

But, either way, the reasons people believe that and partly why the concept came to be, I'd say are pretty valid even if they're based on a misunderstanding - a valid misunderstanding.

It's usually because often when people start dating in their younger years - or trying to - when they get rejected they'll often hear things like:

""I see you more as a friend.""

""I think we'd get along better as friends""

""You're a bit close and I feel like things wouldn't be the same if we dated""

""But... we're friends""

""You're like a brother/sister to me""

See the pattern? It's only natural that once a large number of people hear that regularly, it would send the message that it's their *friendship* or the type of relationship they cultivate with people that hurts them in the field somewhere along the way - I mean, logically it would make sense to draw that conclusion, no? So yeah naturally they will shy away from befriending people they're into and just go for it as an all-or-nothing approach, since they'll associate 'friendship'/siblinghood as something mutually exclusive to being a partner - because, well, that's basically what they're repeatedly told - that it's the friendship that's the dealbreaker.

But then again, there's also the possibility that despite a large enough sample size of people mentioning friendship when rejecting someone, all those lines about friendship and siblinghood and closeness were just sugarcoating platitudes and they're just straight up not into them, for reasons completely unrelated to their approach in the relationship they cultivated and it has nothing to do with that. After all, lots of times people start dating after having already known each other for years. So clearly ""friendship"" isn't always a mutually exclusive dealbreaker. A lot of the time also people develop feelings they didn't have before.

And sure, maybe some have people they actually do feel that way about and their closeness really is what would be a dealbreaker if the idea were to be floated. After all, sometimes you'll hear secondhand gossip like ""Damn, I can't believe John asked me out... he's like a brother to me"". Which is an indicator that it's a little more than 'letting someone down easy' - since they're saying it about someone when they're not around, rather than to their face. But again, it could just be that they still straight up aren't into John and never would have been regardless of their 'siblinghood', and just feel guilty about that and are using that to self-rationalize that mentally. Who knows.

But either way, whether it's real or not, the bottom line is that it has nothing to do with 'entitlement'. It's just a social perception and nothing more.

Plus, when you're going with this definition (rather than the incel definition), someone who ""has someone in their friendzone"" isn't even seen as a bad person with malicious intentions. But rather, it means that THEY fucked up themselves in their approach somewhere along the way and landed themselves in said 'zone'.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017704904668>

Drug addiction, pollution, Police brutality homeless; while these are serious issues, they can be reversed. Once a beloved franchise has been poisoned by the “woke” agenda, the lore has been permanently tarnished. That is why the spread of radically “woke” ideas is the biggest issue facing our country. 

Though there is already a dedicated communtiy of Anti-SJWs, working tirelessly to fight against the WOKE Mob and bravely risking the signifiant loss of Reddit karma, with large scale monetary support we could do so much more. With anti Woke warriors being payed full time to fight against SJWs on Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram, we might actually have a chance of defeating the woke mob once and for all.

The worst thing is, the majority of people don’t even seem to care. Any rational person would be appalled at what has been done to Lola Bunny or the green m&m, but the average person treats it like a JOKE.

Let's say you are a random Ukrainian service worker or office worker working on Kyiv or Lviv or Odessa, and suddenly today you wake up and instead of being in a country called Ukraine you are now part of the country called Russia.

I understand this is truly an unpopular opinion but i think this would've been a net positive to the average Ukrainian and at worst not a big deal at all. 

Now that you're part of Russia, this service worker immediately has access to a relatively powerful passport of a vastly more important and powerful country, and the Odessa business owner now has access to many more domestic companies across Moscow and St Petersburg to do business with much easily. It would be simpler to move across to Moscow for better opportunities and so on.

I don't see the downside for the average person besides the fact that you won't be able to post criticism about Putin and you're not flying a blue/yellow flag? Like, who cares if you're just living your life, is that really the most important thing?

Again, this is a very unpopular opinion I fully understand but I don't understand why a random taxi driver living in Kyiv should uppend their entire life just because the people on the top are Russian or Ukrainian. Why should the random person running the fastfood place in Lviv care who's on the top?

Again, not the war/fighting/shelling part, but in general if it was a fully peaceful transfer of power from Ukrainian govt officials to Russian ones, I don't see what the big deal is to the random grandma living in a small Ukrainian village.

Like I'm American if tomorrow I wake up and the news says starting today my state is part of Canada or Mexico, I'll find it a little weird but mostly I'll just apply for a Canadian/Mexican passport/id and go to work normally?

Turning  vegan changed my life for the better in every possible way except for  the fact that it has caused everyone to treat me like im scum for no  reason at all. From subtle ways to giant ways. It's like this for all  other vegans too and so many of us want to die because of it, so many  actually kill themselves over it and nobody cares, they just taunt  harder and blame your decision to get the same nutrients from plant  sources instead of their behavior.

\-After  i went vegan, any time i shared with others or bought things for them,  theyd begrudingly say ""wow...too bad, it'd be better if it had \*insert  animal product\*"" instead of being grateful or even just silent like they  would be with literally anyone else that they treated like a human.

\-Ever  feel pretty? Ever find a great product you want to share? You can bet  everyone in the world will rip you apart. ""You look like shit in ratty  secondhand clothes, take a shower dirty vegan"" ""That product is total  shit and definitely doesnt live up to the animal counterpart, youre just  lying that its good because you want to manipulate us (???) and no one  believes you for a second lollll!"" If you think this is over the top,  exaggerated or hamfisted you have way more faith in society than i do by  this point. They'll rip apart everything you like, you can hand them a  pretzel and say its vegan and theyll say damn these suck and then you  can say ""all pretzels are vegan"" and theyll just be like ""oh that must  be why i hate pretzels!""

\-If I  ever get openly emotional over the torture and death of things i love,  others either call you mentally ill or say ""wow that makes me hungry,  yummmmmy unnnnfnfffff hell yeah, food porn, better than sex, gonna nut  over this bacon, awesommmme"" and they all think its funny

\-if  you struggle with anything ever, health, depression, even totally  unrelated shit they will always blame your veganism so you must always  put on an act of perfection and never fail at anything ever. I have a  brain condition, i vegan have friends with autoimmune disease celiacs  disease soy/nut allergies etc everyone blames the veganism.

\-If  you ever get fed up and try to stand up for yourself even one time  everyone says theyre ""just joking"" and ""vegans take themselves so damn  seriously, calm down, man vegans are unstable""

\-so  many of us get fucking TORTURED by our parents and peers, emotionally  and physically for it and no one believes us or cares because ""your  parents forced you to eat meat because they care about you, you're  ungrateful"" like bitch NO they do it to psychologically break you  because they cant deal with how it makes them uncomfortable about  themselves, some of my friends even had parents who forced them to kill  and skin their own pets when they spoke up about wanting to be vegan.  Our parents lie to us, get angry at us for minding our own business, my  dad used to scream at me for reading labels silently, for absolutely no  god damned reason other than it is somehow offensive to others to not  want to kill when you dont have to.

\-Everybody  perceives your choices as some kind of insult and they all assume you  think youre better than others so you get called all kinds of names by  complete and total strangers and close loved ones, zealot, cultist,  proselyte, theyll make fun of your body and weight no matter what it is,  if your a man they rip your self esteem to pieces and tell you you're  only doing it cause youre simping for some girl, if youre a woman you  get typecast as a particular kind of hysterical bitchy karen, you get  accused of misinforming, child abuse, pet abuse, classism, pretty much  every bad thing under the sun and you have to deal with feeling like a  monster even though you are doing nothing wrong and in fact they are the  one killing and violating your loved ones and then harassing you.

\-The  best you ever get when you open up about the nonstop abuse and  disillusionment with reality and society is condolences, but always with  the addition of ""as long as you dont talk about it they shouldnt be  treating you like that, also i eat meat sorry"" like they always have  this preconceived notion that i ""had it coming"" because im an asshole or  something and also that i deserve to be silenced about how i feel  towards the unnecessary systematic violent mistreatment and murder of  those i care for.

\-If you ever  speak of this abuse it just potentially prevents others from going vegan  so you feel like you cant speak about it anywhere, even now i feel bad  but im hoping maybe this might inspire some to think more about veganism  or watch Dominion or something, anything, even if they just stop  treating their vegan friend like theyre fucking subhuman thatd be great.

\-You  have to deal with people killing those you love and then making your  life hell for opposing it. You have to deal with their fallacies and  narcissism and projections and lack of education and anger, all while  being perfect and never losing your balance because if you do you  perpetuate a stereotype that validates others reasons for not caring  about the exploitation of animals.

\-The nightmares of the abuse from society are endless.

Veganism  is just getting your nutrients and products from the 80,000 other plant  sources instead of the 3 sources that require exploiting live animals.  It isn't less healthy, it isn't more expensive, it isn't ableist or  classist or racist,  it doesn't mean you're mentally ill or disconnected from reality (we see  it, that's why we are taking really easy action to change it,) it  doesn't mean you think you're better than others, it just means you  think unnecessary murder, ecological destruction, and indoctrination of  humans by megacorporations is tragic and you want to stop it by  educating others and encouraging them to use the countless alternatives.

There   should be a law that pawnbrokers cannot refuse an item. It doesn't   matter if it's not a  name brand, broken, fake, too old, whatever.

The   customer, however, just as  always, DOES NOT HAVE TO ACCEPT THE PRICE.

Reason I say this is because I used to watch *Hardcore Pawn*   all the time. Great show, but the pawnbrokers annoyed the hell out of   me. I've seen them deny things for frivolous reasons, such as:

* A guitar simply because it's not a name brand (as long as it functions I don't see the problem)
* A set of golf clubs because they're Spalding (someone please elaborate to me what's wrong with a set of Spalding Golf Clubs)
* A set of stainless steel earrings because ""currently we're not buying stainless steel.""
* A printer because it wasn't brand new in the box
* A set of speakers because there was a dent in them (they didn't even attempt to test it out)
* A   vacuum that they initially did accept, but then forced the customer to    give the money back because they found out afterwards that it was    actually heavily used and repackaged to look new (that's your fault dude    not the customer's)
* A stereo because the customer was getting upset over the long line

And   then customers get angry because they're denied money they were    supposed to get and that they need, so they say ""I ain't going nowhere    until I get my money,"" which these idiots interpret as ""please have your security drag me out forcibly.""

Breast implants are one of the few cosmetic surgeries we have that consistently look good and have the potential to look natural. There are almost no drawbacks from getting a boob job. 

Boob jobs allow normal skinny girls to look like goddesses. Just about every professional cosplayer trying to look like the best looking girls in fiction realized that the key to looking like a fictional beauty comes down to ""boobs + skinny"". 

Yet some people shame girls that want to get breast implants. ""Oh you should be happy with how you look"".

Why? Why can't we look like our best selfs? I can understand stigmatizing procedure like plastic facial surgery that makes you look like a dehydrated amphibian, but boob jobs don't have that consequence. Boob jobs don't even mean giant spherical boobs. A lot of times boob jobs just make a girl look perkier or bustier than she normally is. I knew a girl that got a small boob job because she was really flat in highschool and no one could tell she had surgery because it was so subtle.

It's just as justifiable as was the invasion of Iraq by the West, both meaningless and pointless. 

What I am saying though is that the aggressiveness of Russia today goes back to the day USSR collapsed. NATO persisted even after USSR collapsed. The entire existence of NATO was  dependent on the existence of USSR. It's purpose was to limit the spread of communism. No USSR? No NATO.

But what happened is that the persistence of NATO made Russia the ""bad guy"" in the world's eye because someone had to be the scapegoat to justify NATOs continued existence (which btw continued to exist to fuel the American military companies). 

What did this do? It antagonized Russia. It made Russia paranoid. The West could've ended NATO to become CLOSER to Russia, but of course that would have threatened the American warfare companies! Of course profits come before world peace!! 

See my point? The West is hypocritical. The West has plundered, raped, colonised, destroyed entire civilizations, and now they have the audacity to act all saintly and patronising? Come on.

But, obesity and diabetes and antibiotic resistant infections are also a problem, though not as severe circumcision. 

Also, head trauma is cumulative and the damage is permanent.  

Aside from circumcision, obesity is a huge problem in the west.  Good habits start in childhood.  If parents educate their children on healthy eating and teach them to avoid industrialized meat that is ladened with hormones and antibiotics, as well as corn syrup- which is far more dangerous than cane sugar, and caffiene-- which is the most abused drug in the world, we'll all be much healthier and our collective healthcare costs will be much lower.  

I agree that the most serious problem facing the Western world is the barbaric practice of circumcision, but we should also restrict the right of parents to feed children toxic-- yet culturally acceptable-- commodities like industrialized meat, corn syrup and caffeine. 

We should also prohibit parents from permitting their children to engage in sports that have high incidents of head trauma.  There is no reason why anybody should play football, soccer or gymnastics other than that they are cultural artifacts.  There's no biological or innate need to play these sports.  Considering how often children are injured while playing these games, they should be banned.

Cultural familiarity and tradition should not be an excuse to allow parents to make poor and dangerous decisions for their children.

I propose that we develop a panel of experts to review all of our cultural elements and traditions to determine which ones are dangerous and undesirable.  Then we can use the power of the state to eliminate the undesirable traditions.  We can call this process the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.

* 48% think federal and state governments should be able to fine or imprison individuals who publicly question the efficacy of the existing COVID-19 vaccines on social media, television, radio, or in online or digital publications. 

* 45% favor governments requiring citizens to temporarily live in designated facilities or locations if they refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

* 47% favor a government tracking program for those who won’t get the COVID-19 vaccine.

* 29% support temporarily removing parents’ custody of their children if parents refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine

It also says:

> __President Biden’s strongest supporters are most likely to endorse the harshest punishments against those who won’t get the COVID-19 vaccine.__ 

So where does the Ukraine fit into this?  Well according to [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccination_in_Ukraine), Ukraine is a country of vaccine skeptics.

* Two polls were held asking people if they intended to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.  In the first poll (Jun 2021), 43% said no, and in the second (Aug 2021), 56% said no.

* By September 2021, Ukraine's official fully vaccinated rate was only 18%.  By comparison, neighboring countries like Slovakia and Poland were already at 40-50%.

* In October 2021, the interior minister reported that Ukraine was ""drowning in forged vaccination certificates"" in response to Europe's digital vaccination requirement.  (Read more [here](https://news.yahoo.com/ukraines-fake-vaccine-certificate-black-145808248.html)).

* At this point it is impossible to know how many people in the Ukraine have been fully vaccinated (because of the rampant fraud), but even the most official / optimistic sources place the number at 50% of the adult population.

With that in mind, I believe that Putin made a significant strategic error by not justifying his invasion of the Ukraine using their vaccine skepticism, the fact that at least half of the adult population remains unvaccinated, and the country's significant problem with fake vaccine certificates, because if he had, many Democrats, including Biden's strongest supporters, would have supported it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017705FEB518>

If the Jews had an option to surrender and not be murdered they would have taken it. Ukrainian should surrender.

Why should they take it?

Because, right now, no one is coming. 
Because Russia has the technology and the manpower to win. Ukraine is not trying to hold them off until help arrives. There is no help that is going to come. Sanctions will be placed against Russia and it will take time for them to do damage. If Ukrainian surrenders the sanctions will still be applied.

If Ukraine surrenders, yes Russia will still murder people but fewer people will die. Fewer people will be left homeless. Fewer kids will be separated from their parents.

Surrender so that you can live to fight from within.


The reason I’m here is because I am certain this is an unpopular opinion but this is a strategic move. No I’m not a bot or a shill. Fuck Putin, he’s acting like a fucking Nazi! Glad to see protests in Russia against him and glad to see Russian troops surrendering to Ukrainian troops.

It seems to me that people have forgotten what freedom of speech really means. Let me re-explain it as a public service.

Freedom of speech means you're exempt from being arrested or otherwise punished by the law for what you say, barring major exceptions.

It  does not mean that you're exempt from criticism that others may have  for what you say, or the consequences of your choice of words, because  that would be an impediment to OTHERS' freedom of speech.

Perfect example comes to mind, from a now-infamous post on Facebook from like 2009:

**Hill to die on--**

You're using a military expression with which you have no personal experience to inform people of your obdurate and unyielding opinion. It's too dramatic and it doesn't mean what you think it means. Nobody wants to die on the hill. They're ordered to die on the hill. The metaphor doesn't mean that you're making a noble stand against strong opposition. It means your being forced to waste your life defending something that doesn't matter. It's an expression of nihilism, not certainty of conviction. To that extent, it means the opposite of what you clowns use it for.

**Red flags--**

What does this even mean? What red flags? When do you encounter red flags in your life? What is the origin of this cliche? Why not just say ""warnings"" instead. For example, what are some ""red flags"" that a person is a mindless conformist? You could replace ""red flags"" with ""warnings"" and avoid a meaningless cliche all together.

**Bonus--**

Stop accusing your opponents of ""arguing semantics"" or ""projecting."" You never win the argument when you say that. To the contrary, you're basically admitting that you're giving up.

Finally, stop quoting internet laws or the names of logical fallacies. They don't mean anything other than that you identify yourself as part of a subculture that knows these things.

I think the idea of non-binary gender is kind of weird, since most of the time it seems to be just people defining their personality traits and personal style as a separate gender. However, the idea of gender being rigidly linked with certain personality traits and appearance is a conservative idea. Non-binary people are only going along with it.

Every time someone with traditional views about gender said something about how a ""real man"" (or ""real woman"") acts in a certain way, dresses in a certain way, etc. they were creating a foundation for the idea that some people aren't really male or female, but something else. Therefore, if you have a guy who, for example, likes to paint his nails, then that conservative view would separate him from ""real maleness"", and that logically creates another gendered category that isn't either male or female.

179,sygr2y,Comparing Covid lockdowns To Laws Against Drink Driving Is A False Equivalency,CutEmOff666,1645512046.0,5,0.62,11,"Comparing covid lockdowns to laws against drink driving is a false equivalency for a multitude of reasons.

1: Laws against drink driving do no violate established civil liberties. They do not impact freedom of expression, freedom of movement, the right to a speedy trial, the right to be free from searches without a warrant or the right to work. The same can't be said about lockdowns.

2: Laws against drink driving are limited in scope. They only require somebody to refrain from drink driving. Lockdowns impact most if not all aspects of a person's life. They impact the person  both socially and economically and in so many other ways.

3: Laws against drink driving do not cause harm. Although not being able to drive home while drunk may be annoying, the benefits of not driving home drunk absolutely outweigh downsides. Lockdowns cause widespread harm to society including social, psychological and economic harm. This harm disproportionately harms the most disadvantaged and vulnerable members of society.

4: Laws against drink driving achieve their intended purpose. Laws against drink driving do in fact save lives and are supported by science. Lockdowns save little to no lives and are not backed by science. Every pandemic plan prior to covid-19 opposed lockdowns and current studies are showing that they have slim to none impact on saving lives from covid-19.

5: It is more difficult to use laws against drink driving as a political weapon. Lockdown rules can easily be used to target and shut down political groups and movements. This is seen in both third world countries and in western countries as well. For example, Victorian Premier Dan Andrews shutting down the entire construction industry to punish them for a protest and the Chinese government using covid restrictions to restrict the travel of political dissidents.

6: Laws against drink driving are proportional to the threat of drunk drivers and there doesn't seem to be any viable alternatives to laws against drink drivers. Lockdowns are disproportionate  to the threat of covid-19. Although covid-19 can make people from some demographics very sick, it doesn't pose a serious threat to the average person. We also have some vaccines that can reduce the severity of the disease.

SEX - sexuality - sex organs - sexual pleasure, they all have evolved from the fundamental need for reproduction. 

IF you subscribe to the Theory of Evolution, which you hopefully do, you know that no organ is random. If it was not for reproduction, penises and vaginas would not have existed in the first place. So SEXual organs, SEX, etc, is connected to reproduction.

You can not reproduce with ""oral"" or ""anal"" sex, therefore those are NOT sex.

More so, those are stupid and make no sense. First because you'd want to save your semen to ejaculate in a vagina, so it's against your own reproductive interest to waste it, second because vaginal sex is 1000x times better than ""anal"" or ""oral"" sex. Also, why would you put your penis inside a disgusting hole where feces come out and why would you put your penis in a mouth, where teeth are? Even if the woman is very skilled, it's still nowhere near the sensation of PIV sex.

Last but not least, oral sex was not even popular at all until very recently, as it was popularized by degenerate porn. Anal sex even less so.

189,sx4ayb,The Unvaccinated Need Education Not Coercion,CutEmOff666,1645372707.0,31,0.68,59,"People who are unvaccinated are not unvaccinated because they are selfish, evil and want to hurt nor are all of them stupid. Many unvaccinated people are simply misinformed and have concerns about the vaccine. Like any other medical procedure, it's not unreasonable to want clarity that what you are putting in your body is safe. 

Each unvaccinated person is different and has different reasons for refusing the vaccine. Some of these reasons are totally understandable. I can't blame Aboriginal Australians for not wanting the vaccine given horrific atrocities committed against them by the Australian government. Not wanting the vaccine because someone you know had a bad reaction is also understandable.

Contrary to popular belief, most of the unvaccinated would be open to getting the vaccine if their concerns were addressed. To those who argue that the unvaccinated 'can't be reasoned with', maybe the reason they weren't listening to you is because you were insulting them and acting in a condescending way.

Also to note, disadvantaged communities such as low income, POC and immigrants have lower vaccination rates and worse health outcomes in general. These groups often struggle more with accessing correct information and have less contact with healthcare professionals. 

Also, calling someone stupid for being misinformed isn't productive. It doesn't achieve anything other than making them not listen to you. What you should do is present them with the correct information in a calm, intelligent and non condescending manner. They aren't nessecerily stupid, they are misinformed. 

Treat it like sex ed. We don't get angry at a teenager who is misinformed about sex? We give them the right information. We don't call them stupid and refuse to explain things. When a pregnant woman is making a decision that could negatively affect her child, we counsel and educate that women and we ask her why she is making the harmful decision and her concerns.

It would be a good idea to invite these people to seminars where they can ask questions about the vaccine without being judged. Have people they trust and can relate to such as community leaders promote the vaccine instead of untrustworthy politicians and burocrats and elitist celebrities. 

The person promoting vaccination should also not have any known political affiliation. These people are open to getting vaccinated. They just need assurance and the right information. Coercion on the other hand is both unethical and counterproductive. 

Coercion is a violation of civil liberties and sets a bad precedent which will affect other bodily autonomy issues such as the right to abortion, the autonomy of pregnant women, blood donation, organ donation and forced psychiatry. It also makes people feel violated and this causes distrust in doctors and the medical system which leads to poorer long term health outcomes.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017706376BA8>
190,sx2n3o,I dont believe in freedom of religion in so far as it should not override other laws,WaterDemonPhoenix,1645367989.0,15,0.68,41,"It should be at the bottom while id like this mentality to apply world wide, im focusing mainly on canada. What I mean is, if you want to pray, if it doesn't violate any other laws, then of course you can pray. But when stuff like vaccine exceptions are being made because of religion, that should be a no no. If personal beliefs allow you to opt out, then everyone should be able to. 

my view is that exceptions should not be made on the grounds of religion. If your religion dictates you violate employment laws then no, you should get a pass. 
No accommodation should be made for religious people unless they show proof that it will cause them undue stress. But they must go through the process of mental health same as anyone. You can't just claim that you have mental health issues and skip class. you need a doctors note. Churches should not get exemption on taxes just for being churches but must show proof of charity work. (Same goes for mosques, temples etc) 

I don't buy the argument that people say its cultural. I would love to have Chinese new year off but because its not religion it doesn't get a pass. And thats fine by me if its symmetrical.

so, whenever you hear a rape case up north (south for you mericans), you also hear about the people who bitch and moan about them dressing like a prostitute and they deserve it (even though its false, like, really false) they dont realize that they are wrong on every level. 

for just a second, let's just believe conservatives when they say the reason for someone's assault is their clothing (even though it isn't). Obviously, if we consider that logic, then we could come to the conclusion that the person wearing the clothes is dumb, or stupid to do it (because in their minds they think that's why they got assaulted). however, that doesn't excuse the rapist, because they are taking advantage of a 'dumb' person. no matter how you look at it, the perpetrator is always at fault. so what confuses me is why do they get angry at someone for being dumb, and not someone who is taking advantage of someone dumb. 

and if any of you guys say ""oH BuT tHey mUsT haVe WanTeD iT iF tHey dreSeD lIkE thAt."" then i will do nothing probably. anyways the victim said no in the process, so why the fuck did the person continues.

Firstly, his philosophy is what? Nominalist, positivistic, materialistic, aristocratic, anarchist, what?

He don't give any argummentation about his philosophy, it's just cultural critique of a sad man, and anger about his mom.His vision about religion is idiotic, and his framework of the superman is just turning back the clock to tribalism and unnecessary violence. If you like Nietzsche, you like things as murder, torture, pillage and political oppression of the weak by the strong. And he says this explicitly, as in his *""Genealogy of morals""*, as i quote:

*""And we are the first to admit that anyone who knew these ""good"" ones only as enemies would find them evil enemies indeed. For these same men who, amongst themselves, are so strictly constrained by custom, worship, ritual, gratitude, and by mutual surveillance and jealousy, who are so resourceful in consideration, tenderness, loyality, pride and friendship, when once they step outside their circle become little better than uncaged beasts of prey. Once abroad in the wilderness, they revel in the freedom from social constraint and compensate for their long confinement in the quietude of their own community. They revert to the innocence of wild animals: we can imagine them returning from an orgy of murder, arson, r\*pe, and torture, jubilant and at peace with themselves as though they had committed a fraternity prank""*( censure by me).

Second, his ethics is just moronic. He tries to construct a virtue ethics but without a solid teleology and  sees the agent as a just of junction of impulses and social constructs to impress people. He even shouts things like this: 

*"" The astral order in which we live is an exception; this order and the considerable duration that is conditioned by it have again made possible the exception of exceptions: the development of the organic. The total character of the world, by contrast, is for all eternity chaos, not in the sense of a lack of necessity but of a lack of order, organization, form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever else our aesthetic anthropomorphisms are called. Judged from the vantage point of our reason, the unsuccessful attempts are by far the rule; the exceptions are not the secret aim, and the whole musical mechanism repeats eternally its tune, which must never be called a melody - and ultimately even the phrase 'unsuccessful attempt' is already an anthropomorphism bearing a reproach. But how could we reproach or praise the universe! Let us beware of attributing to it heartlessness or unreason or their opposites: it is neither perfect, nor beautiful, nor noble, nor does it want to become any of these things; in no way does it strive to imitate man! In no way do   our aesthetic and moral judgements apply to it! It also has no drive to self-preservation or any other drives; nor does it observe any laws. Let us beware of saying that there are laws in nature. There are only necessities: there is no one who commands, no one who obeys, no one who transgresses. Once you know that there are no purposes, you also know that there is no accident; for only against a world of purposes does the word 'accident' have a meaning. Let us beware of saying that death is opposed to life. The living is only a form of what is dead, and a very rare form. Let us beware of thinking that the world eternally creates new things. There are no eternally enduring substances; matter is as much of an error as the god of the Eleatics. 1 But when will we be done with our caution and care? When will all these shadows of god no longer darken us? When will we have completely de-deified nature? When may we begin to naturalize humanity with a pure, newly discovered, newly redeemed nature?""* As Pablo Olmedo wroted ( my translation): *""a priori structures are not ahistorical and independent of sensitivity, if the organization of our reason is variable, in the sense that it is subject to a development process, it is not possible to affirm the need to think the bodies organic from the consideration according to final cause"".*

See this guy as he really was: the founder of the descontructionist and woke rethoric of facts don´t existing and: ""all that exists are power plays"". The only difference is that he love power plays and opression, as he wroted:

*"" it should be clearly understood that in the days when people were unashamed of their cruelty life was a great deal more enjoyable than it is now in the heyday of pessimism -- the bog of morbid finickiness and moralistic drivel which has alienated man from his natural instincts... Nowadays, when suffering is invariably quoted as the chief argument against existence, it might be well to recall the days when matters were judged from the opposite point of view; when people would not have missed for anything the pleasure of inflicting suffering, in which they saw a powerful agent, the principal inducement to living. By way of comfort to the milksops, I would also venture the suggestion that in those days pain did not hurt as much as it does today; at all events, such is the opinion of a doctor who has treated Negroes for complicated internal inflammations which would have driven the most stoical Europeans to distraction -- the assumption here being that the negro represents an earlier phase of human development""*.

Or here: 

*""For my part, I am convinced that, compared with one night's pain endured by a hysterical bluestocking, all the suffering of all the* [*animals*](https://www.friesian.com/moral-1.htm#animal) *that have been used to date for scientific experiments is as nothing.""*

So many great thinkers of this period of time( Lortz, Brownie, Boutroux, Schiller, Kikergaard) and people read and love this stupid moron? Just no, no!

What this means is that to maximize chances for reproduction a healthy male would want to save it up and use it during actual sex, or at least with a woman.

Contrary to popular opinion, you don't need to ""expel"" semen, it's not a waste product like urine or feces. The sperm that is too old gets broken down and reabsorbed and new sperm is created. This is not some voodoo, cult semen retention superpowers thing, this is exactly how the body works. You do NOT need to get it out.

- never had to worry about being raped or killed by your date 
- never had people assume negative 
stereotypes from your skin colour 
- never been told to go back to your own country
- never been threatened or attacked for religious beliefs

Those are all examples of privileges that someone might have. What’s the point of refusing to acknowledge that you have things that other people don’t? 
Just imagine if I was talking to someone homeless. This is how it would go if I was in denial:

Homeless guy: 
> *The differences between you and me is that you have a place to live and I don’t.*

Me, being a fucking idiot: 
> *Yeah well I get locked out of the house sometimes; we basically face the same struggles so stop attacking me.* 👉🏼👈🏼😣🥺

Why? Learn to be grateful for what you have and considerate of those that have less. Everyone has different obstacles in their life, different experiences, and different struggles. Keep that in mind and get over your ~~Doug dimma-dumbass~~ self.

Pamela Moses, a Black Lives Matter activist, was sentenced to probation in 2015, for 7 years, for various crimes including stalking, harassment, forgery, etc. In 2019, she claims to be uncertain whether or not she was able to vote and inquired about it, and a court told her that she was still on probation and was ineligible to vote. As far as I am concerned, that should have been the end of it.

Now is the part of the story that we are expected to believe but makes absolutely no sense: she was still confused as to whether she was still on probation, so she went to the Department of Corrections to state that she felt there was a possibility that court had given her the incorrect information, and now, a Department of Corrections officer told her she was no longer on probation, was now able to vote, and was given paperwork to demonstrate it. At this point, she filed to reinstate her voter registration, and is now sentenced to prison for 6 years for voter fraud and trying to vote while a convicted felon. She now claims she was not made aware that she was not allowed to vote, especially since she had not been formally removed from the voter registry beforehand. 

If she did not know that she was unable to vote, she would not have gone through the entire process to reinstate her voting registration. Does she think we were all born yesterday? 

I do believe that someone in the Department of Corrections provided her false information. I do not believe that she was actually confused as to whether she was still on probation. 2015 to 2019 is 4 years, out of the 7 for which she was on probation. When sentenced, you are informed of the civil liberties that are taken from you at the time. I think she went to the Department of Corrections knowing she was on probation, hoping that the clerk would be persuaded by her story and not do their due diligence to confirm otherwise (which is exactly what happened).

Now, do I think 6 years in prison is excessive? Yes. She may be given the opportunity after 9 months of good behavior to just go back on probation for an extended period of time, which I would say is on the LENIENT side. And there is a conversation to be had as to whether or not felons should lose their right to vote. But do I believe her story?
