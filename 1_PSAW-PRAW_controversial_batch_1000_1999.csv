0,uqlm9j,Conservatives use identity politics just as much as liberals and leftists,Professional-Home110,1652668241.0,11,0.6,23,"We just use it in different ways. While the left uses it to discuss the oppression of different minority groups, the right uses it to ""own the libs"" and talk about how white people, Christians and men are oppressed. By using it to ""own the libs"", I'm talking about people on the right calling anyone who criticizes a black conservative a racist, saying that it's impossible for a minority who's a conservative to hold any racist views against their own group and tokenizing conservatives from different minority groups in order to do the ""black friend"" defense. They use ""white liberal"" as a pejorative and they often pick out anecdotal evidence of minorities who think that something white liberals consider bigoted isn't actually bigoted so they could call anyone who thinks it is a ""white savior"" and accuse them of ""getting offended on behalf of that minority group""

I am aware that when conservatives use identity politics to ""own the libs"", they think they're exposing liberal hypocricy. The problem is that this is often based on a misunderstanding of what we actually believe

Edit: I acknowlege that there are some legitimate grievances with how men are treated and the expectations society places on them. But you don't oppose all identity politics if you have no problem with talking about them",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777B3CD860>
1,uqhnjy,The republican party will lead this country into fascism,TarnishedTryHard,1652654982.0,0,0.49,82,"The entire republican party has completely disconnected from reality.

Their only beliefs are that of what they are told to believe by their media spheres and what they believe will attain them more political power. 

The concept of bipartisanship does not exist anymore. Regardless of what type of legislation is put forth republicans vote solely based on what is in line with their party.

There are GOP members openly admitting that democracy is an issue. And after the 2020 election we got a sneak peak at how republicans do not care about democracy. 81% of republicans still believe the 2020 election was stolen. And the moment they gain power again in this country they will do everything in their power to dismantle the safe guards of our democracy. And they will do so under the guise that “they have to prevent the democrats from rigging elections again.”

The republican party is following the exact same road Nazi Germany and every other far right government in history has. 

They demonize higher education, they co-opt populists economic talking points to appeal to disenfranchised workers, they use minority groups as a scapegoat to institute more and more authoritarian laws, they do not believe in an objective reality or any sense of scientific truth, they demonize the media (they literally use the term “fake news”, a term used directly by the Nazi party”), and they use nationalist rhetoric as a way to demonize their opposition because anyone who opposes you must inherently be anti American. 

At this very point in time, we have open Nazis, white supremacists, and conspiracy theorists in government seats as part of the GOP.

MTG and Bobbert are congresswomen and are open Q-Anoners/nazis and believe in the great replacement conspiracy theory. And what has the GOP done about it? Nothing. We have MTG going to literal Nazi rallies hosted by literal Nazis, and giving speeches. 
We have the wives of supreme court justices telling their husbands to overturn the 2020 election because she is a Q-Anoner and then having that husband vote against confirming the election results. 

Yes, the democrat party is shit. And yes there are people in it that should not be in positions of power. But the worst thing you can accuse democrats of being is weak and ineffectual at properly addressing and combating the impending threat the GOP poses. 

There will be a day very soon in which the United States falls to these people. A day in which radicalized right wingers fueled by years of intense directed misinformation kill democrat politicians, and the republican party will refuse to condemn the actions. And when it does I hope all the minorities and liberals in this country have decided to get over their fear of guns and decide to have ways of protecting themselves using their 2nd amendment right. 

I do not intend this post to change anyones mind. As anyone who votes republican at this point in history is no longer swayed by reality. However I leave this post here so when this all does happen I can at the very least take a fat shit on the heads of all the liberals and centrists who prescribed to this phony sense of bipartisanship. And to join the leftists of every previous right wing dictatorship who warned of the impending fall into fascism.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777B407080>

But we not only need to watch out for these groups that dedicate ""jokes"" its also the way YouTube and other algorithms are set up to create positive feedback loops ensnared young impressionable minds into the alt-right from another [article](https://harvardpolitics.com/alt-right-pipeline/)

>I gradually cycled through the videos that my new, extremely skewed frame of reference deemed “acceptable,” avoiding only the most flagrant content. By then, however, YouTube had worked its magic and determined what would appeal to me most moving forward. Videos recommended through the YouTube algorithm account for 70 percent of time spent on the site. Without thinking, I let the “up next” timer run down, and I was directed to the next video then the next, each more aggressive than the last And so began a months-long tumble down the alt-right pipeline, but I was never able to acknowledge that I was trapped. I still considered myself a progressive; in my mind, I was not buying into the alt-right’s rhetoric, I was learning their arguments to make my progressivism stronger. But I was more easily persuaded than I knew, and even if my intentions were sound, Ben Shapiro spoke too quickly and Steven Crowder too aggressively for me to be able to process what I was hearing beyond a superficial level. My teenage mind could not keep up, and without any conscious understanding, I was cheering along with Jordan Peterson as he “destroyed” feminism and as “SJWs” were “owned” with “facts and logic.”

The latest argument is the 14th amendment, which is hilarious. If a woman can legally end the life of a child, a unique set of DNA that will fully develop into a life, then a man can have an equal opportunity to end their responsibility.

The government has no say over a woman's responsibility to carry a child to viability, or even to term. But the government can force a man to pay, forcing a man, under threat of imprisonment, to provide his body and his labor, to another person against their will.

Hate to break it to you but they’re not comparable. They never had the number of guns we had or the gun culture we had. Plus they’re all island nations, making it easier for them to control shipment of illegal firearms from foreign countries.

All Johnny does is make some dope ass movies and turn up. ""Yeah a lot of people drink/smoke/do drugs in Hollywood!"", yeah but how many of them are this lowkey?

Johnny doesn't look for popularity or for media fame, he doesn't go to clubs and bars going wild and making highlights. Everything he does is solely for him and with him. He doesn't bring the paparazzi with him. 

Whether or not you smoke, drink or do drugs, that's one thing you should respect. He doesn't glamorize it and he isn't in the media talking about it. And it doesn't seem to be ruining or running his life (like a lot of these drugs addicts fucking up their whole Hollywood lives). 

I smoke. I drink. I do drugs. And I would definitely like to just chill with Johnny, not even on no fan or questionnaire shit. And he's still an talented, amazing actor. 

If Amber really thinks this is going to ruin him then she's on some drugs. Disney is on some drugs too for not casting him. But this trial is making him look better n better lol.

I learned to spend time working on things that I actually find some enjoyment in, rather than things that are difficult. I kept my general aim at finding work that I enjoy that pays well, rather than work I hate.

Nietzsche was famous in-part for writing about the false dichotomy of master-slave morality, a system people choose (all the reddit leftists and all the conservatives who despise them are absolutely locked in this Nietzschean nightmare). The whole ""I worked my way out, no one else needs a handout"" is still on the master-slave morality spectrum.

1. Thinking that no one should get a helping hand comes from a place of believing that *you yourself are fundamentally undeserving of help,* so you work your way towards a place where instead you can gain your needs from others through interdependence. It's poverty itself that builds this mindset; many of the wealthiest yet most ungenerous people I know are people who grew up poor who are now wealthy - and these are people I love very much and have a good relationship with overall, so it's not some chip on the shoulder. It's just something I see past and don't bring up, kind of like it's not my business.

2. It's fear-based thinking, in that it seeks an independence from human interdependence that *simply does not exist.* It's a foolish attempt to never have to depend on the good will of others.

I find the arguments of the pro choice crowd just not convincing.  I think there are plenty of steps one could have taken before it having to come to abortion. 

Many women use the argument ""it's my body so it's my choice"". But it's not only your body, it's also the body of your unborn child that is effected. Both your rights and that of your unborn baby should be taken into account when making this decision and I think when making such a decision the right of the (unborn) child to live should carry more weight. 

But you are not ready to have a baby? Maybe you should have thought of that beforehand! Use condoms and other forms of birth control. And yes, I am aware that there is still a residual chance of both the condom and birth control failing. And that's a risk you can either accept, or you should avoid having heterosexual intercourse all together. And I don't mean this as an argument against sex. I mean that so many things in life carry risks that we can only accept. When we get in our car or on our bike, we have a chance that we die in a traffic accident. Just as much as having sex means there is a risk that 9 months later, a little miracle will happen. 

Also, I think any decision on what the maximum period to have an abortion is, is completely arbitrary. What is the difference between say 6 weeks or 6 months? Or 6 months vs 9 months? Why does a baby that is almost fully grown have more right to live than a baby that's just conceived? 

Plus, I think people should really take more consideration at the option of adoption. Anonymous if you have to.  An argument I often hear against that is that adopted children have a higher chance of becoming a dropout or a criminal and those are sad statistics. But at least those children got a chance to do something better with their lives and there are plenty of stories out there of people who grew up without their parents and who still did something great with their life!

I admit there are situations like when rape was involved, or when the life of the mother is in danger that are ethically more challenging and I could certainly understand if we keep special exceptions for those situations. But that's only a small percentage of all abortions out there.

I would like to add that I'm against those people who protest outside of abortion clinics. I think christian extremists like that just give the pro life movement a bad name. As protesting extremists in any movement destroy the image of their movement these days. 

I would like to say I do not live in the United States. But what's happening there right now I do feel like people have a bad opinion on people who are pro life. And I most of all just wanted to share my view with the dominantly American crowd on this website in the hopes that we may better understand each others viewpoints and I am certainly willing to discuss these with you guys in a mutually respectful manner.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777B919780>
31,uneikb,I like disinformation better than regular information,ChickenSoupForMyDick,1652288404.0,0,0.42,5,"I like disinformation better than regular information. Let me use the issue of climate change just to illustrate my point.  

**Information:** ***The global average temperature is Increasing at an alarming rate.*** ***Humans are likely the cause.*** ***If drastic measures are not taken to address this problem, millions may die, and the world civilization could be irrevocably changed for the worse.*** 

Yikes. How depressing is this? It’s crappy news at face value but then its suckiness is even compounded when I realized that, I’m contributing to it when I drive my Ford F150 Double Cab back and forth from my office job and when I understood that we can’t solve this problem with violence. I’m a big fan of action movies, and I love it when the hero kicks, punches and shoots his way to victory over the bad guys. But, where are the bad guys? You can’t launch missiles at hurricanes. Seal Team Six can’t assassinate a drought. Agh! I hate this information. Can someone please help!?

**Disinformation:** ***Climate change is a hoax being promoted by billionaire leftist George Soros*** 

Ahhhh. I felt like someone put ice on a burn when I read these words. I don’t have to worry anymore, at least I don’t have to worry about climate change anymore. Who is this Soros character? Maybe I should worry about him. Let’s see. Apparently he’s a billionaire who funds protest movements around the world.  He’s planning to engineer an international economic crisis. He’s behind both the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine. He is a Nazi and plans to take over the world and establish one world government. 

Grrr….I’m not mad at this Soros, it’s releasing dopamine into my bloodstream. I hate him! But I love him for having a face that I can imagine myself shooting! Maybe someday someone will shoot him. And then justice would be served! 

**Information:** ***George Soros is the subject of many conspiracy theories.*** ***Most of them are rooted in anti-Semitism.*** 

Oh no! What a disappointment! Not only have I lost my scapegoat, but now I feel embarrassed that I don’t know what this “anti-Semitism” is. Turns out it’s the belief that Jewish people are inherently bad and that they run the world through various conspiracies.  Moreover, anti-Semitism can have horrific consequences. Turns out some guy named Hitler started a group called the Nazis. The Nazis systematically murdered over six millions Jews in the 1940s during something call “the Holocaust”. How awful! 

I feel so stupid! I fell for a hateful lie. And there’s no way that Soros can be a Nazi, he is Jewish! Agh! I’m embarrassed! And I might have to go back to believing in that horrible climate change! 

**Disinformation:** ***There was no Holocaust.*** ***It was made up by Jews like Soros as part of their agenda to take over the world.*** 

Wait, what?! Have I been fooled again? There was no Holocaust?

Let me think about this for a bit….yeah, sounds good. If there was no Holocaust, I can go back to blaming George Soros for all the things I don’t like. Moreover, I can add all “Jews” as a stand in for Soros. He’s just one guy that I’ll probably never meet but I know that there are Jews in my town. Perhaps I can let them know about how I feel about their nefarious plot to take over the world. And, there are lots of other people in my town that I have never felt comfortable about too. Some of them are men who have sex with men, some of them speak Arabic and some Spanish. Yuck. 

But guess what? Turns out Soros (and all Jews) support something called “Cultural Marxism” which is designed to make people feel bad about their natural affinity for people of their own heritage and to undermine Western civilization through support for immigration and undermining traditional values. 

Makes sense to me!

while i do completely agree that batman and robin is a piece of shit, i really don\`t agree that having it to his name makes schumacher a horrible director.

he did direct batman and robin but he also directed flatliners, the lost boys, falling down, 8MM, phone booth, and many other great movies. the lost boys is one of my favorite vampire movies, falling down is a brilliant dark comedy about a man who\`s had enough, 8MM is a dark and gritty movie in the same vein as se7en, flatliners is one of the best movies about the afterlife ever made, and phone booth is the type of movie hitchcock would have made if he lived in the 21st century.

joel schumacher made a bad movie. well, what director can safely say that they haven\`t? there are several extremely talented directors with at least one dud to their name. ang lee directed hulk almost immediately after his martial arts masterpiece crouching tiger hidden dragon. francis ford coppola of the godfather fame ended the 20th century with jack. future best director winner james cameron began his feature film debut with piranha 2 the spawning. unless the director\`s name is quentin tarantino or stanley kubrick, no director has a completely flawless filmography. schumacher is no different. some directors have better filmographies than others and i feel that joel schumacher perfectly fits the description of a director who\`s successes outweigh their duds.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777B8B8C50>

Free  Tibet is one of the most stupid movements in America, and can be  treated as a fast way to find out if someone is a reddit NPC.

Tibet  as an independent country would be surrounded by extremely hostile neighbors like China, that would love to make an example out of any  separatist, or pretty anti-Buddhist India. Tibet separatist movement  does not have any broad support, and is a fringe movement of wholesum  religious extremists. Tibet does not have a big population, and it would  decrease further after succession, and would struggle to fight back or  even just use its resources effectively. I am not going into how China leveraged its infrastructure to improve Tibet's wealth, since one may argue their resources could afford even more wealth. I personally don't agree with that argument.

Even if it was a good idea, supporting it is not. If you are an American  basketball player or a Hollywood star, supporting this cause means you  either believe your own country is a utopia and there are no problems  with it currently, or (more likely) you deliberately chose a cause so  distant and impractical to appear radical without doing jack, then got  offended that another country can use tools to ensure its national interests. Practical implementation of Free Tibet would largely  distabilise, militarise and further turn Asia and the world away from  democracy. Of course, American military will help it become freer than it even dreamt to be, then leave to watch a country with hostile neighbors, armed religious fundamentalists and no tradition of democracy  turn into a chaotic wasteland.

42,um5fm4,The Black Pill argument is completely untrue.,ProgressTemporary110,1652141937.0,0,0.38,35,"Those who believe the Black Pill theory believe that looks are genetically determined, and that women choose sexual partners based solely on physical features (“lookism”), so whether or not a person will be an Incel is predetermined. The part that is completely false is “women choose sexual partners based solely on physical features”. NOT ALL women choose partners based on looks, some do but, the statement is still false. The argument I hear a lot from guys who DM me is “women only want a 6’ Chad”; when I tell them it is simply not true they ignore it & move straight to insults. The reason I know this is not true is because I am married to a man who is not 6 feet tall. My sister is dating a man who isn’t 6 feet tall. Plenty of other women are living proof that a man doesn’t have to be ridiculously tall to get a girlfriend.

Now back to the Black Pill argument, not all women choose sexual partners based only on looks. Also, “looks” is very subjective, one woman can find a person attractive, and another can think they are unattractive. Yes, looks matter. But it’s an unsound inference to go from this experiment to the conclusion that “all women judge all men primarily and forever on the basis of their appearance”. I don't think these men are as ugly as they claim they are, it's just a way to keep this blackpill-narrative and blame women instead of taking a hard look at the mirror and see how much time they've wasted on this instead of growing as a person. If they think women, 51.1% of world population, are personally against them, maybe the problem isn't women. Growing just needs to happen outside of the comfort-zone. If you turn down a date you might get called a bitch. If you have sex on a first date you might get called a slut. If you get in a fight with your boyfriend because he’s a dickbag, you might get called a whore. I’ve been called a slut for not having sex with someone I did not want to have sex with.

Arguments on the basis of 'immigrants have a hard life, therefore deserve to enter US/France/Britain/whatever country' is not a convincing argument at all.

Example 1: Critical Race Theory

The Left is advocating for discussions in schools about racial equity (""equality of outcome"" which is different from equality of opportunity), labeling entire demographics as ""oppressor versus oppressed"",  and teaching that the very foundation of this nation (the US) is rooted in racism and that the system is irredeemable. This is a divisive ideology which creates tension between friend groups, makes children suspicious of one another, and is only a THEORY as to explain the inter-group dynamics in this country. It involves taking every claim of oppression at its word and deferring to individuals' view of their own oppression rather than assessing data to assess whether the claim is actually true... and taught to young, impressionable children. 

Anyone who is opposed to this is told they ""oppose teaching American history."" They are painting opposition to something extreme as opposition to something reasonable, to make it look like the other side is simply against teaching history and is heavily invested in maintaining racism. They do this to sneak extreme elements into the curriculum. This is not true. I learned American history in schools and about its atrocities. I learned about the Slave Trade, the Civil Rights movement, the Trail of Tears... I understood at a young age that these things were wrong and that as a society we need to treat one another with kindness and move forward. That is not what they are pushing for now, which is a very dulled-down version of CRT which teaches that the system is irredeemable and certain demographics are ""oppressors."" 

Example 2: The Florida parental rights in education bill.

The Left is suggesting that this bill is designed to ""prevent students from knowing that LGBTQ+ people exist"" and that the goal is to prevent children from discussing their families, and ""to prevent against teaching LGBTQ+ history"" (here we go with history again)! 

In reality, this bill is designed to prevent incidents such as this ([https://www.news-press.com/story/news/education/2022/05/05/cape-coral-florida-teacher-casey-scott-fired-discussion-sexual-orientation-pansexual-lgbtq-flags/9649148002/](https://www.news-press.com/story/news/education/2022/05/05/cape-coral-florida-teacher-casey-scott-fired-discussion-sexual-orientation-pansexual-lgbtq-flags/9649148002/)).

This teacher claims that students asked her questions about her sexual orientation, she answered that she was pansexual, explained what that meant, and then gave an assignment for the students for their next art project which involved designing a pride flag for their own sexual orientation, which was subsequently hung on the wall. This teacher not only told students who and what she is attracted to, which is entirely inappropriate, but encouraged them to reveal their own sexual orientation in a way that she, the entire class, and the entire school would know about it. IT IS ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR ADULTS TO DISCUSS THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION WITH CHILDREN.

Other examples include teachers telling kindergarteners that they ""don't need to pick their gender yet"" and telling them that the American flag is a symbol of imperialism and forcing them to pledge allegiance to the LGBTQ+ flag instead. 

But opposition to this bill is painted as ""being against acknowledging that LGBTQ+ people exist.""",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777CEBC978>

Yeah, it sucks that there's no magical objective 'ought'. We SHOULD have the right to be free. But doesn't mean we will always have this 'right'.

I'm just really confused when people act like there is some sort of 'inherent right'. The law states that abortion is a right. If that changes, I'm not arguing 'but it's my right'. It's a tautology or something. If it stops being the law, then it is no longer a right. It should be. But the argument can't be 'it's a right' when it longer is. That just doesn't make sense.

People mistake my view that it's not a right as in 'so you think it's ok to own slaves?' No, it's not ok, but it's not a right in the past. It is a right now and I'd like to keep it that way, but if we changed, I'm not arguing that some 'right' exists.

Who honestly and truly wants to wait until they’re that old?

A few years ago I was talking to a friend who was in a relationship (still going strong 🙄) about how annoying being single is. They said “you’ll find someone” and I said “lmao yeah, when I’m 40.” And then they had the audacity to say “there’s nothing wrong with finding love in your 40’s”

Personally I just don’t think that’s true at all. Being single in your 20’s and 30’s makes you a loser.

A video can be seen where a large crowd surrounds the man and takes turns stomping and kicking his head.  Dave Chappell, Jamie Foxx and Busta Rhymes all apparently joined in.

And no, it isn't always a good thing. People say ""Oh you have extra intelligence/empathy, that's always a good thing!"" No it isn't. You don't understand. Extra intelligence comes with tons of problems: perfectionism, pressure from family, hidden mental issues like ADHD. Too much empathy can make people lose sleep worrying about people all the way on the other side of the globe. Too much empathy can lead you to cling to those who leech off your care and give you nothing in return out of the urge to ""fix their lives.""

I wrote this because I personally know someone who fits the definition of ""empath."" Hearing about someone else's hardship makes her feel severely depressed. Hearing any bad news causes her to lose sleep worrying about people she doesn't even know. She also has a sort of urge to ""fix the person's life,"" and it crushes her when she can only help to a point (e.g. suggesting therapy to someone who doesn't want it). She avoids almost all social contact because she is worried someone will casually drop that their spouse was abusive, or their brother is in jail, or their friend died in a car crash. She tries to avoid the news, but sometimes gives in to the urge to go on the internet. She knows she can't just fix everyone's life, but she cannot control what she feels.

(I know she needs therapy, but she won't go because she doesn't think it will help. She says she is perfectly fine with her hermit life. I can't force her to go, but I do my best to help and support her.)

67,uix991,I support all abortion because of rape,babno,1651756686.0,0,0.47,25,"Yes, I'm well aware that rape accounts for <1% of abortions. I'm also very big on taking responsibility for your actions, which would normally put me towards the pro life side, with an exception for rape, as I and most people could not conscionably force a rape victim to carry it to term.

Where I diverge is what I expect reality would be if we banned abortions with a rape exception. I have a pretty bleak view of human nature, and don't see this as a stretch in the slightest. Consider the following.

A woman has voluntary sex and becomes pregnant. She wishes to abort. She then goes to a doctor, lies and says she was raped and is pregnant with a rape baby. We now have 2 possible scenarios.

Scenario 1. Take her word for it with nothing further and grant the abortion. If all it takes is a quick lie, I have no doubt virtually every abortion seeking woman would do so without hesitation, and the ban would be utterly ineffective.

Scenario 2. Who's the rapist? Report him to the police and press charges. Of course there is no rapist here, but she's desperate to get an abortion, so she'll accuse an innocent man. Not every woman would do this, maybe not even most, but there are nearly 900k abortions per year. If even 10% of women did this then that's 90k innocent men being charged, likely losing their jobs, paying thousands in legal fees, the stress, the stigma for the rest of their lives. And that's if they're not convicted. It's also billions of taxpayer money to fund these prosecutions, plus clogging up the justice system even more making things take even longer. Meanwhile the woman has gotten the abortion, because you can't wait for a year until the outcome of the trial to do it.

That's my thoughts on the matter, unpopular on the right because pro choice, unpopular on the left because women lie about rape.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777D2D9080>
68,uirp4w,Nobody really wants freedom.,dreadington,1651734284.0,0,0.5,27,"Freedom is a very powerful word, and it's included in the constitution of every single democratic country in the world. Freedom is seen in literature and media as the ultimate value and goal of everything. If you don't have freedom, do you have anything at all?

However, does anyone really want a ""radical"" freedom? Let's look at some aspects of freedom.

1. In the Soviet Union, during the reign of Stalin, the Soviet constitution stated, that it supports a multiparty system, and that if a group of people wanted to create a party, the state would support that. Reality, however, is *a bit* different. You have the freedom on paper, but not in practice.

2. Radical freedom means to be free of the consequences of your actions. I technically have the freedom to go and slap my boss right now. But the consequences of that action are so punishing, that it's not real freedom is it. To be really free in that sense, would be to be free of the consequences of my actions. For an individual person in a vacuum, it's kinda cool to not face consequences. But do you want to live in a word, where *anyone* is free from consequences of their actions?

3. Freedom often has rules. Think of driving a car. You're free to go wherever you want. But there are rules, such as driving on the right side of the lane, speed limits, traffic lights, areas where overtaking is not allowed, etc. Would you have more individual freedom if those rules were lifted? Yes. But it would have a disasterous effect on society as a whole.

4. Freedom of speech. Truly a great thing. But what if the person exercising their freedom of speech is trying to gather support for a dictatorial and genocidal coup? Or just a regular genocide, where he wants to get rid of anyone belonging to group X. By granting that person their freedom of speech, we actually remove freedoms of people belonging to group X.

5. Hypocrisy. In some states, the same republicans that preach the importance of freedom of speech, are banning school books containing ""uncomfortable"" topics. Clearly they too realize, that radical freedom is not a good thing.

6. One or the other freedom. Some will argue that ""these days you can't say anything"", let's say about gay people. However, back in the early 2000s, unless you were in an extremely liberal metropolis, you couldn't talk about being gay. Something being ""gay"" was used as an insult. There was even a joke tweet about how wearing jeans that fit would get you labeled as a metrosexual. A gay person couldn't just come out. Compare to now, where apparently you can't be critical of gay people. If you had to choose between the freedom of being yourself, or freedom of speech, which one would you chose?

7. A lot of people who are complaining about freedom of speech on reddit, are just complaining of being downvoted. This is a reaction of the community. If you meet with a group of friends and start talking shit about one of their partners, you will get backlash. Similarly, if reddit deletes your comment, you might feel like your freedom of speech is restricted. But imagine you go to a Magic the Gatheric game store and start talking about how magic the gathering sucks or even ""MTG is for cunts"". You'd get thrown out. There are absolutely time and place to talk about MTG, you can even say you don't like the game, or even better you can discuss the limitations of the game, and how it has changed during the years. My point is, there are constructive ways to express opinions, and there appropriate places to express opinions, and there always have been rules about how and what and when we should talk about.

It is obvious and has been shown countless times that restricting abortion does nothing to lower abortion rates. Here's a couple sources: ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/3415/)) ([2](https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2021/09/22/study-shows-abortion-ban-may-lead-21-increase-pregnancy-related-deaths)) ([3](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/abortion-rates-don-t-drop-when-procedure-outlawed-it-does-ncna1235174)).

Therefore, by restricting access to safe abortions, anti-abortionism is driving safe abortions in medical settings underground into shady unsafe back alleys, which is causing more deaths than the 'babies' it is supposedly saving. Hundreds of women died in unsafe abortions before Roe v Wade ([4](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/29/planned-parenthoods-false-stat-thousands-women-died-every-year-before-roe/)).

In fact, abortion rates are actually higher in high-income countries that restrict abortion compared to high-income countries that don't restrict abortions ([5](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-worldwide)). The only meaningful way to actually reduce abortions is by expanding access to contraceptives and sex education ([6](https://www.guttmacher.org/report/adding-it-up-investing-in-sexual-reproductive-health-2019)).

Banning abortion also creates a hostile environment for women who miscarried, such as in this case ([7](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/10/texas-woman-murder-charges-dropped-self-induced-abortion)).

83,ugte7c,At-will employment needs major changing,fartichokes,1651508567.0,2,0.56,22," 

Everyone knows that employment at-will is the concept that employer or employee  can terminate employment at anytime for any reason, including no reason  at all.

I think that needs to be modified, because this is harmful to employees.

First off, verbal-written-termination should be the universal disciplinary norm.

What  I am suggesting: If an employer feels it is necessary to terminate an  employee, documentation needs to be provided. Examples:

1. If  an employer wants to fire an employee for wearing a red shirt, the  employer needs to cite their company handbook that forbids red shirts  and document said employee wearing red shirt. Document verbal, written  warnings regarding wearing of red shirt.
2. If  an employer feels the need to take away the jobs of other employees for  economic reasons, document projected P&L showing how financial  situation will improve ONLY by taking away jobs. It's stupid to lay off  people because you're not doing well; that's like saving gas by removing  half your engine. Doesn't make sense.
3. If  an employer wants to pull some vague BS like ""employee wasn't working  out"" or ""employee wasn't growing into the role,"" document it and prove  it. You can't just hide behind a vague phrase like that, it's cowardly  and unprofessional.

All  terminations will be reviewed by the same respective office that handles unemployment (usually the state's respective Department of Labor or equivalent). During the state's termination review, the employee should be paid full wages in Unemployment. If the state rejects the company's  termination (i.e. doesn't think there's sufficient reason/evidence), the employee is reinstated. If not, the termination stands, and the  employee is paid full-wage unemployment, but decreases by 2% each week  until it's run out.

Example: Employee is paid $1,000 a week

Week 1 of unemployment: $1,000

Week 2 "" "": $980

Week 3 "" "": $960

Those who fanaticize science as a belief are just as overbearing, unscientific, and annoying as religious zealots. 

Pretty much all science is fallible. Scientific “facts” of 50 years ago, or even 5 years ago, change constantly. Things we believe to be facts today are not facts tomorrow.

Putting all of your faith in scientific fact is, in my opinion, just as “baseless” as putting your faith in a Creator, and for this reason - you have to be just as “religious” to be an atheist as you have to be “religious” to believe in a God.

Your own religion is what you make of the world around you essentially - and how it came to be. You have to put *faith* in an idea, an opinion on how things came to be.  

To put it simply, staunch atheists are just as religious as staunch Christians, Muslims, etc.

Evidence is based on what? Another man’s opinion or perspective. You must literally put faith in other men’s observations.

Even then, humans are faulty. We constantly make mistakes. Many things that were believed by everybody about science in the 40’s have been found to be completely untrue. Just because it was “science” back then, doesn’t mean it is true. Imagine how many things we take as scientific fact today, that will be found to be false in the future. You are putting faith in those ideas.

You haven’t seen the formation of the Earth for yourself, so you must put faith in an ideology for how it came to be.

I want to be clear about something, I’m not saying that all science is false. I’m just saying that it is verifiably very possible for a little or a lot of it to be faulty or downright false. Your own personal faith in these scientific ideas is what bridges the gap between a given ideology and what you believe.

90,ufh6xg,"There is a big loophole in the ""pro-choice"" movement that needs to be addressed...",Cut-Unique,1651343939.0,36,0.7,81,"So, I am pro-choice. But I have a different definition of it than most people do. For me, pro-choice isn't strictly about abortion. Abortion is a big part of it, but once you make it safely out of your mother's womb, you're no longer dependent on someone else's body to keep you alive, and therefore it most definitely is ""your body, your choice"", which I am a firm believer in.

""My body, my choice"" means a lot of things. It means not being forced to undergo any body modifications, like circumcision, piercings, tattoos, etc. (I'm not against those procedures themselves, they just shouldn't be forced upon anyone, especially young children). It also means that children shouldn't be forced to undergo any medical procedures, therapy, etc. without a significant amount of input. They shouldn't be forced to go to therapy for problems they don't actually have, and if they do need to go to therapy, the therapist should listen, ask questions, and take into consideration what the child is saying. The parents would of course still have to sign off on everything, but the therapist should be able to say ""Your child has made it very clear that they do not want to do x, y, and z because it makes them uncomfortable, and I don't think it's in their best interest to force them to do it. You are the parents, but your child is their own person, therefore they should have a say in what happens to them.""

Another thing is that pro-choice to me means pro-life, pro-death, and the ability to choose between the two. If a woman chooses to have a baby, that is her choice. But if a person wishes to die for whatever reason, and it can be proven that it's their decision and they haven't been coerced, they should be allowed to do so.

Now, here's the loophole. Many of the people who support the pro-choice movement are also very adamant that people should get vaccinated for COVID. I am vaccinated, so are my parents, and I'm very glad they chose to do so. My family is pretty liberal (I wouldn't say that we're far-left extremists, but we're left-of-center), yet they said that, while they encourage people to get the vaccine, ultimately it is their body and their choice. If they don't want to get the vaccine, they shouldn't be forced to get it. Again, my body, my choice.

Cars may still be the dominant form of human transportation in the US, but the infrastructure is actually improving, at least where I live, they're literally building a hiking trail from Austin to San Antonio 




However, the other forms of infrastructure will never catch up in the US, because the US never had time to actually establish its infrastructure on other behalves of transportation, since the US by the time the industrial revolution hit, had to deal with the pressures from the higher powers that be to pioneer the automobile


And not only that, are we forgetting that like 50-70% of America is very rural? Even major cities have their fair share of rural parts, how the fuck is having a less car-centered infrastructure going to be efficient for the people living in those areas? 


And if other forms of transportation were dominant, it would make transport of consumer goods even more impractical 


I do have a bias because I am car enthusiast who unironically doesn't have their license yet, but I am not too trigger happy to start driving because I know it is a huge responsibility, and it still costs a shit ton of money the course anyway


But still get real, is an impractical nothingdream of a wish to want a less car-centered infrastructure in America 

Plus cultural significance 

Europeans are more localized and more community-oriented

Americans are more individualist and more overaching, in American culture, even non-enthusiasts associate cars with individual freedom and personal responsibility and it is a major part of adulting owning and driving a car, even if owning a car is a hassle to some extent, many won't still deny the joys of being in control of your very own car, I don't think the majority of people want to trade off that very individual liberty for more comfort and securtiy 

Plus commute times would even more screwed up for the people, if cars were to be outright banned


Again Europe is more localized where as America is just more overaching, the average home to grocery store distance in America is like 3.79 miles, not a whole lot, but are we really going to waste time doing all these walks to grocery stores?

I get that lore wise the transistor and microprocessor weren't invented until way later on down the road, but I offer a counterargument, there were no microprocessors or transistors in the 1800s, yet architecture, culture, and clothing all changed drastically over the course of that century. Just look at how men dressed in the year 1800 and how they dressed in 1899, it's a stark difference.

You think women look prettier because you are a straight man not because women are actually more aesthetic. And the average man does mog the fuck out of an average woman since for his genes to even exist, the men in his genealogy had to be chads while the women only had to have a pulse.

Plus look at other animals. Even ugly male peacocks mogs a female peacocks because of how colourful and elegant a male peacock is... We see the same thing in mammals. Male lions that look subhuman compared to other males still mog female lions because of their elegant manes and more muscular bodies.

Even in humans, men are taller, broader, and more muscular. Our faces are more angular, our eyes are more piercing because they're deeper set. Our jaws are more chiseled and defined.

All of a sudden retard doesn't inherently mean 'you're dumb because you're disabled, and being disabled is wrong'? Are you kidding me?

Here's the real truth, both words are inherently wrong, but because gay people have a voice, look like us, talk like us, work like us,etc. YOU became inclined to brush off every single insult that could be related to them.  
But disabled people don't have a voice, they can't do many of the things 'normal' people do. So it's easy to forget them, it's easier to accept insults derived from them as regular lexicons.

If you defend the use of words like 'retard' while peeing your pants when someone says 'faggot', you're a massive hypocrite. You just want to use the former because you love using the word and don't want to get rid of it.

It is not the poster's responsibility to find the source, if someone sees the post and is interested it is their own responsibility to find the source or ask if someone knows it.

Another point would be that by forcing such rules way less people post because they can't be bothered to look for the sauce and don't deny this when most people are often too lazy to click once or twice more in every UI ever created.

This leads to communities having reduced interactions, posts and so on and can even lead to the end of communities due to inactivity, the less people post the less they are seen and the less others are willing to post.

You are free to post the source but you have no right to force others to do it as well

You;re basically looking at your data page by page, hitting the down button or scroll bar and then waiting and waiting for it to load like poor some kid in the early 90s with a 2400 baud modem

If these pages weren't annoying enough, they have also turned the End key into the most useless key on the keyboard - it is effectively now just another PgDn, which was a pathetic key anyway since you can just use the down arrow or scroll bar to do the same thing.  PgDn is so irrelevant that they never even put it on the same place in a laptop keyboard, but End is now even less useful.

What I am proposing is simple - the End key should do what it says on the label, which is take you to the end of the web page. So for infinitely scrolling web pages, which have no end, they should just continue to load data until there is nothing left to load, or until you've exhausted every scrap of RAM and hard drive space your system can find, compressing all of your old data if necessary, or maybe just deleting it if you have a recent backup.

I understand that people may complain when there is no way to abort this procedure so I would also propose a pop-up confirmation that comes up the first time you use the End key on an infinitely scrolling web page that says something like:

###You have just pressed the End key which is the most powerful key on the keyboard.  This is your one and only warning.  We are not fucking around here.  

Then we would show a clip of Will Smith smacking Chris Rock at the Oscars just to show that shit is, indeed, real.

And then, from that point on, the End key will operate the way that it was always designed to, which means that on an infinitely scrolling web page, your computer will load all of the data available or die trying, and will rightfully respond with angry beeps if you hit Esc or try to close the browser window, just to make it .clear how much power the End key now wields.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777B17ED30>
109,ucs3kv,If vegans are so worried about the environment and animal suffering they should start eating insects,UnpopularBrainRot,1651023092.0,3,0.58,26,"First of, I believe we evolved as ovnivores, we should get our nutrition from all sources to be healthy, a plant only diet can be done but you must be very disciplined, monitor your diet really closely (and in some cases take supplements) or you risk being malnourished or have other health problems.

Now, every now and then when I see a discussion about food there's that guy with their moral high ground claiming we don't need to eat animals, and because of that is immoral to inflict distress and suffering to said animals, destroy ecosystems to make grounds for raising them for human consumption, and generally harming the environment more than we need to.

And there is some validity to these claims, however if they are really that worried about animals and the planet, and want to live a life style that is less harmful and sustainable, they should start eating insects as a core part of their diets.

Insects are insanely easy to breed, they have a really high protein content per gram, they need less space and resources, they are all around the best choice as a sustainable food source.

And if you my friend are concerned about insect suffering, you're far too gone, are you concerned about that mosquito you just smacked?, Or that cockroach you stomped with your foot?.

The only reason reason people don't like it is because cultural conditioning, where I'm from people eat some species of grasshoppers and ants, cocked or grounded as ingredients for other dishes and it's normal.

111,uc7nbe,"""Marketplace of ideas"" won't happen unless platforms implement an lQ test requirement.",Far-Explorer-2300,1650961130.0,0,0.38,9,"The marketplace of ideas is the notion that the good ideas will dominate in a sea of competing ideas. It sounds good in theory, but this makes the flawed assumption that the majority of humans act rationally and in good faith, when this is not true. People have biases and emotions that cause them to ignore reason. Furthermore, many topics are inherently complicated; people may not always be willing to listen to the nuances of a topic or they may not even be capable of understanding them.  Because of this, it's not necessarily true that the best ideas will dominate in a marketplace of ideas.

For a platform to successfully implement a marketplace of ideas, its users have to be capable of rational thought and willing to prioritize rational thought when contributing to the marketplace. The former of these two is relatively easy to implement. By making some sort of intellectual puzzle or test a requirement to creating an account, you can weed out people who are incapable of higher-order thought. These tests should also present themselves randomly from time to time while someone is using the platform in order to mitigate cheaters who have someone else help them make an account. If the test is not completed in time or the person performs poorly, their account should be locked for some time. Repeated failures to complete these tests should result in a ban, with the opportunity for an appeal. This is not a perfect solution, but I think it will really minimize the number and impact of irrational individuals on a platform, ensuring that the majority of users are people capable of reason and logic.

The other problem, that the majority of users must be willing to prioritize reason is much harder to solve. Intelligent people often resort to irrational arguments out of their desire to promote an agenda. If the majority of users on a platform are like this, you're not really going to have a marketplace of ideas. It may sound unlikely that the majority of people on a platform are just going to be agenda pushers, but I'd argue that this isn't the case at all. The people who are most vested in a platform to share ideas are the people who want to push agendas. They will be the ones most likely to participate in this sort of thing as well as the ones who will spend the most time participating. People without an agenda are probably not going to participate as much. The only potential solution that I can think of is some level of content moderation, but this runs the risk of leading to censorship, which ruins the whole idea of a free marketplace. If anyone can think of other potential solutions to this problem, please mention it.

Even if we don't have a solution to the second problem, I think any platform that solves the first problem will be much closer to achieving a marketplace of ideas than any other platform that exists. Weed out the people who can't understand reason and you'll have one less problem to worry about.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777B75B860>

For example, if someone has bad eyesight and they therefore get glasses, this isn't discriminatory against those with good eyesight. The same principles applies to affirmative action.

White people experience life from a privileged perspective, but they often fail to realize this, because the privilege is invisible to those who experience it - the privilege they receive is not being held back or discriminated against for their race in any way. Since this privilege is the absence of something rather than the presence of something, it could not be perceived without knowing what was absent.

New technology might *lessen some* effects, but it would likely *increase other* negative effects on society (that may or may not be climate-related). Being more environmentally conscious would delay it, but it's only a matter of time before that doesn't work. And even if individuals are more environmentally conscious, big companies, which do just as much damage if not more, will never be held accountable because people in power are greedy.

Plus, you can't get all of society to do one thing, it's futile. The pandemic has proved this. People are far more divided now than they ever have been. People won't wear a face covering to keep themselves or others from dying, either because they don't understand or they don't care. Getting everyone to use clean energy, take public transport, etc. won't work, especially since some people live in areas where these options are unaffordable or near impossible to achieve.

If anything, we should be preparing FOR climate change rather than whining about how we can't stop it. We might be able to create facilities that can withstand extreme heat/water and stay cool and dry inside. With our new medical knowledge and technology, we might be able to develop vaccines/antibiotics for the ancient deadly diseases that could plague us. Stuff like that. But even that stuff would probably become futile after a while.

It is likely that climate change is a natural event that has been greatly increased by human activity, meaning it would eventually be inevitable no matter how hard we try. I DO NOT DENY THE YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT PROVE THE EARTH'S TEMPERATURE BEGAN RISING MUCH MORE QUICKLY AT THE START OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. I am offering up the possibility that while human activity has GREATLY SPED UP the Earth's temperature, that the rising may be something that would naturally happen eventually, just not for thousands/millions/billions? more years. Why do I think this? Probably because the existence of an Ice Age indicates the existence of another extreme, a ""heat age."" Anyways, humans are very intelligent, but we are not entirely above nature and natural processes. Eventually, humanity will run its course somehow. We can try to delay it, but it is inevitable. And I have a feeling the Earth will recover okay if/when humanity is wiped off it. As George Carlin says, ""The planet is fine. The PEOPLE are fucked.""

We have this superficial desire to build up society as much as possible, while avoiding the fact that these advancements will most likely lead to our demise. The pattern is seen again and again throughout history, yet we cannot learn from it. But then again, what else are we to do? We are only human. Inventing technology, advancing society, etc. seems to sort of be what humans do. You would think that our ability to be aware of the effects of our behaviors would lead us to do something about it, but a lot of us are so caught up in our own lives that we don't bother. In a way, that makes us sort of animalistic. We are still animals, still a part of nature. The evidence of this is stronger now than it ever has been.

In the end, the net negative is that humans will no longer exist. In the greater scheme of things, this changes almost nothing. Perhaps there will be missed opportunity, but again, that is looking at it from a human's perspective, not a universal perspective.

From a universal perspective, we are pretty small and insignificant.

This is a bad assumption; many times people who get into positions of power do so because it brings them satisfaction in seeing everything destroyed.

Mass shooters operate this way.

So, one day, someone in power in a foreign country may pull the trigger on starting a nuclear holocaust. We need to be prepared for that eventuality, and not stick our heads in the sand about that not happening.

We've had nuclear weapons for what, 75 years? We deluded ourselves about thinking that large scale war in the West was over basically right up until Putin launched his little genocide in Ukraine, which goes to show how naive people are about the possibility of actual widespread destruction.

Additionally, people just assume that a nuclear war would be the end of the world. They just imagine it being like everything gets blipped out of existence, like Thanos snapping 100% of people.

Nope. You may very well survive, and in fact, society may even continue, but it'll be sudden and shocking like the COVID pandemic, just 50x worse, where it's an interesting novelty as its happening, but eventually gets really boring and shitty after a while.

That's what it would look like.

So, what we should do is be able to survive a nuclear war well enough that it's no longer mutually assured destruction, but mutually unacceptable destruction.

That is, with two rational actors in the nuclear war payoff matrix, mutually assured destruction still more or less prevails. But, in this case, the destruction isn't so complete or total that someone in a non-democratic society would be able to even achieve the destruction of their enemies.

So, say we have the capacity to ""win"" a nuclear war, but the cost would still be enormous. That's better than mutually assured destruction because we're sane enough in our stable, democratic societies. But our nuclear adversaries would also know that we'd suffer enough destruction as to never want to pull the trigger.

How many times have you seen a movie where one character slaps another in front of a group. Everybody says ""wow"" stops talking...pause for a second....and then the group goes on with whatever they were doing.

Have you ever seen an entire movie's plot be derailed because one character slaps another ? Then the slapped character spends the rest of the movie pressing charges ? No. This doesn't happen in movies.

And it doesn't happen in real life either. Bar fights and road rage happen all the time. I've never seen a person make court case out of being slapped once. Neither have I ever seen 2 men drag out the incident and turn it into a daily argument.

Yet the media companies constantly firing Will Smith from all of his projects, and the SJWs online cheering on this punishment all seem to think so.

I find this pearl clutching response is pathetic. Anyone with a working brain knows that this is a minor incident. 


For Pete's sake....even Chris Rock's brother wanted to addhis 2cents to the incident.

If everytime somebody slapped or shoved a person....it went to court ...the court system would be completely filled with frivilous lawsuits.

Everyone has lost their temper at some point or the other ...maybe you didn't slap someone, but maybe you cussed them out, maybe you made an obscene gesture

The only reason people are reacting like this is because it was celebrities. If this had happened at your local bar over the weekend...by now we would have forgot it. You probably wouldn't even remember, and whoever was slapped, probably he wouldn't be talking about it either.

You can probably find the video of her last ever performance less than a week before her passing, I've seen it and it's pretty morbid.

So yeah you probably know where I'm going with this. Given JB's condition, it is questionable whether he even *wanted* to run, much less be president - but of course as we all know, given the circumstances and the situation, the pressure to push it was insane and through the roof and he was kind of cornered into a position where he couldn't say ""no I don't want to run"" even if that was the case. But it really does seem a bit worrying how during his speeches with the constant gaffes, it almost seems like he doesn't really want to be there - which is a little sad and depressing and rather morbid when you think about it like that.

So in a way it does kind of remind me of that situation Amy was in, if that makes sense.

Even intellectually bankrupt outlets like CNN admit this:

> https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/health/us-homicide-rate-increase-nchs-study/index.html

...with data showing that the murder rate skyrocketed 30% in one year between 2019 and 2020, largely connected to the violent 2020 rampage that swept cities across the US and the ""abolish the police"" rhetoric. Meanwhile, some cities it was particularly horrendous, with Portland having a 250% increase in shootings in September 2020 vs 2019:

> https://www.koin.com/news/crime/stats-show-dramatic-jump-in-portland-shootings-during-2020/

...however, many in the mainstream media have marginalized and disregarded this news, only giving it cursory coverage and sidelining discussion on it for the most part. As anyone in the US can attest, the nation's skyrocketing murder rate has NOT been one of the primary topics of discussion within the domain of social media and broadcast talking heads, despite how shocking and disastrous such a development is for the nation and, obviously, for the urban communities that these murders are plaguing.

What is truly racist is that the establishment media and social media will not start giving any appreciable coverage and discussion to this subject until it starts affecting white lives. It is only then that people will begin to react and declare that something needs to be done. As long as the victims of these murders are overwhelmingly minorities, the bodies that direct mainstream media discussion will largely ignore this topic because, 1.) they don't care about urban murder within minority communities and 2.) they are afraid that covering it at all will make them look racist. However, you can be sure as sh$t that if hundreds upon hundreds of white kids were getting shot and murdered across American cities every month, there would be round-the-clock coverage, they'd start making new laws named after victims, people would start taking the skyrocketing crime seriously, etc etc. And herein lies the irony, the mainstream media actively ignoring the urban murder out of fear of looking ""racist"" is infinitely more racist than marginalizing it in favor of white victims being murdered. Furthermore, it doesn't help that even activists groups who make their mission focusing on the murders of minorities ignore this issue.

148,u87jy1,"The 1984 song ""Smuggler's Blues"" by Glenn Frey about the War on Drugs is the most important political song in 40+ years and is more relevant than ever today",IanArcad,1650491619.0,2,0.67,5,"Glenn Frey's 1984 song ""Smuggler's Blues"" explains how drug money corrupts everyone, from the dealers and smugglers, to law enforcement and the politicians.  [Lyrics](https://www.songfacts.com/lyrics/glenn-frey/smugglers-blues).  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSXKyHM133c).  It is forever associated with the TV series Miami Vice as the writer (Micheal Mann) heard the song on the radio during the first season and put both the song and singer in the show.

    The sailors and pilots, the soldiers and the law,
    The pay offs and the rip offs, and the things nobody saw. 
    No matter if it's heroin,  cocaine, or hash,
    You've got to carry weapons, cause you always carry cash. 

How are drug crimes actually prosecuted?  As Radley Balko, of Reason magazine writes in his 2010 article [How Drug Cops Go Bad](https://reason.com/2011/03/21/how-drug-cops-go-bad), virtually all criminal prosecutions are based upon police informants (who get reduced sentences), or the police themselves setting up the drug deal, potentially manufacturing crime.  (In fact, police prefer to sell drugs rather than buy them, so that they can keep the cash and then sell the same drugs again.)

    There's lots of shady characters,  Lots of dirty deals.
    Every name's an alias, In case somebody squeals.
    It's the lure of easy money, It's gotta very strong appeal. 

For this morally dubious behavior, they are rewarded with forfeiture proceeds.  There are many police officers and former police officers who are against the drug war, partly because they have seen its corrupting influence on law enforcement.  But not every drug dealer is willing to get ripped off by police or each other, which is why drug-related homicides account for somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 of all homicides.  Drug users also account for a significant fraction (15-25%) of burglaries.  (Note that different studies define drug-related crime in [different ways](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/246404.pdf)).

    See it in the headlines, you hear it every day.
    They say they're gonna stop it, but it doesn't go away. 


CNBC, 2021:  [America has spent over a trillion dollars fighting the war on drugs. 50 years later, drug use in the U.S. is climbing again.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/the-us-has-spent-over-a-trillion-dollars-fighting-war-on-drugs.html)

> “__We are still in the midst of the most devastating drug epidemic in U.S. history,__” according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, senior fellow at the Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology at Brookings Institution.

While lots of people say they are against the drug war, it means absolutely nothing if you vote for the same people who continue it every year.  People who actually put their reputations on the line to help non-violent offenders, like Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, are few and far between, and Trump never received any credit for his First Step Act that freed thousands of non-violent offenders, including [Alice Marie Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Marie_Johnson).  Ron Paul supporters know the feeling.

The sad fact is that nobody really cares about drug addicts or drug prisoners - they've been forgotten by both liberals (who abandon old causes just as quickly as they jump onto new ones, and whose issues are now vetted by their corporate backers) and by old-school conservatives (who like certain kinds of big government and authoritarianism and happily ignore that there is no constitutional argument for Federal Drug enforcement).

    It's propping up the governments in Columbia and Peru,
    You ask any D.E.A. man, He'll say ""There's nothin' we can do"",
    From the office of the President, Right down to me and you,


The drug war was started by Richard Nixon, but escalated significantly in the 1980s due to the efforts of Senator [Joe Biden](https://theintercept.com/2019/09/17/the-untold-story-joe-biden-pushed-ronald-reagan-to-ramp-up-incarceration-not-the-other-way-around/) who argued that the nation's drug enforcement budget should be equivalent to the nation's military budget.   

> It was Biden who was among the principal and earliest movers of the policy agenda that would become the war on drugs and mass incarceration, and he did so in the face of initial reluctance from none other than President Ronald Reagan. 

Biden has never paid a political price for this and it looks like he never will, making his way from Senator to Vice-President to President, as Democrats gave him a pass (he did after all bring in a ton of financial industry money) and moved on to other issues.  The message to politicians is clear - if you want to win elections and advance in politics, just turn poor addicts into criminals.  Of course Biden's own son, Hunter, was addicted to crack and even took photos of himself smoking it, and yet has never served a single day in jail.  Rich kids get treatment and poor kids get locked up.

    It's a losing proposition, But one you can't refuse.
    It's the politics of contraband, It's the smuggler's blues, 

At this point, even though it's a failed policy, it looks like the odds of ending the drug war are basically zero - there are simply too many people making too much money from it and too many politicians whose careers are invested in it.

In a Monday morning news conference, Mr. DeSantis highlighted the presence of “social and emotional learning” material in the rejected elementary school textbooks. 

This sounds absolutely terrible right? Those evil leftists must be sneaking CRT on the math curriculum. You might be wondering about the details of this prohibited material, are they teaching that white people are inherently and fundamentally evil? Even worse, are they telling kids that black people aren't terrible? 

Well let's see for ourselves what this controversial material consists of. 

From the New York Times: 

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/18/us/florida-math-textbooks-critical-race-theory.html

A review of sample content from one publisher whose elementary school textbooks appear to have been rejected, Big Ideas Learning, showed lessons intended to build self-awareness, self-management, responsible decision-making and social awareness and relationship skills. 

That framework of five skills is a popular one in schools across the country, and was developed by CASEL, an education nonprofit. 

In one text, cartoon animals help build one another’s confidence in order to cross a wobbly bridge. In another, a cartoon dog movie star says she feels lonely, and other animals offer to befriend her. 

CASEL defended the idea of including social and emotional concepts in math lessons. “Research confirms that social and emotional learning bolsters academic achievement because it helps students focus on learning and engage more deeply with content,” the company said in a statement. “If our nation prioritizes the academic growth of young people, we must also prioritize their social-emotional learning.” 

Attempting to stimulate a child's imagination in order to help them engage with otherwise dry arithmetic? We simply can't have that. Helping an old lady cross a bridge is far too woke, perhaps Ron DeSantis believes we should be pushing them in front of busses.

On the less extreme angle, testosterone is what's responsible for men's ambitious and competitive nature. No less harmful to be sure, the drive to ""win"" and ""conquer"" in day to day life is what makes men engage in zero sum ventures like daring games at its least pernicious, and profit seeking schemes at its most, where in either case the goal is to gain as much ""capital"" as possible at the expense of everyone and everything else, even if it causes fractures and divisions among each other, stratification of society, and irreparable destruction to the environment and climate.

The idea that we would run out of consumables because supply chains would be broken is also unfounded. When people die demand drops equally as supply drops. For example, when New York gets hit, you may not get any more apples from there, but there's millions of people less who want apples. Some cities, like Detroit, would be an economical gain if it was nuked. 

People also have weird misconceptions about radiation. They think an area that has been nuked will just be radioactive forever.

If for example China had to fight a massive war against India, it would probably look similar to what is happening in the Ukraine now, and the western media would probably ask ""why were we afraid of China when they are so bad at fighting?"". 

Hell, if the US ever got their own country invade, they would fight equally bad. Imagine if South America united under some ideology or ruler, then invaded through Mexico.

Alright. I get that someone's voice/accent can be intentional, but I think saying stuff like 'it annoys the hell of me' does not need to be said. I don't care how annoying you find Kim Kardashian, or regular Joe Shmoe. Like Joe Shmoe might have the same 'accent' as Kim Kardashian, but maybe it's 'unintentional'. I don't get why hating on Kim K's accent is fine but if I hated on, say, some random Indian immigrant it's not. Why is making fun of texas people's accent ok but not, random Chinese dude? A lot of Texans say dumb shit. So do New Yorkers, or Indians, or whatever. However, I don't criticize them for things that really isn't worth criticizing. (And I know reddit loves putting words in my mouth. I don't like Kim Kardashian, but I don't think there's any point in criticizing her 'vocal fry'. Thats her business if she fucks up her vocal cords. I also don't care about Texans for being Texans. Texans that vote for anti abortion laws can fuck off, but I still won't bully them for their accent because just because you have an accent doesn't mean you are anti abortion.) Like, for example, this is unpopular among atheists. It irritates me seeing atheists that, while criticizing  Christians put on a Texan accent. Imagine if I was criticizing 'Indians' and put on a fake Indian accent and going like 'see this is all the dumb shit Indians say'.

An accent is like a stutter. Not everyone can just switch off accent any more than you can switch off stutter. And if you can, it's very hard.

People with high voices also can't help it. Yeah, some people fake it, but damn, if you've ever been nervous, your voice goes high too. Honestly, why does it need to be said? How is saying 'I won't watch this TV because the actress has an annoying voice' any different than 'I won't watch this show because the actor is an ugly black fat man'???

191,u2ja5n,People who hate landlords are basically just incels,moveitorloseit9999,1649828585.0,0,0.45,27,"  

Ok, hear me out. Incels:  
 

1.) View sex as a fundamental human right (it isn’t!), and that to be denied it by the women they’re attracted to is like denying someone a basic human necessity.

2.) Have a hatred of “Chad”, an amalgamation of various male archetypes that basically amounts to the “guy that gets all the girls”, leaving none for them

3.) Wish harm upon women and Chad, the “gatekeepers of sex”, and congregate in various forums/communities to speak ill of them and describe all the disgusting, heinous shit they want to happen to them (seriously, if you check out some of the incel forums, they venerate school shooters like Elliot Rodger and constantly wish for women to be killed, raped, or enslaved)

4.) Could probably get laid if they lowered their standards, worked on themselves, or just rented a hooker. For example, maybe they should stop trying to get with 10s right out the gate. Or if they’re really deadset on someone out of their league, they could work out, get therapy, and overall try to be a more attractive prospect as a partner. This isn’t a guarantee that the incel can eventually get with their “dream” girl, but doing these at least increases the chances of it. And if they don’t end up with them, hey, they’re in a better position to find a partner even if whoever it is isn’t their “first choice”. Alternatively, if self-betterment sounds like too much work and sex is the only goal, just pay for it. No shame in that.

Sex has never been a fundamental human right. Incels aren’t even being denied sex, they’re being denied access to sex with women they find sexually attractive. While I can sympathize that it sucks that they can’t get with these girls, believe me when I say there are probably thousands more they could realistically get with. They should stop thinking just in terms of the women in their town/state, try thinking globally! 

Now, people who hate landlords:  
 

1.) View home-ownership as a fundamental human right (it isn’t!), and that to be denied it is like denying them a basic human necessity.

2.) Have a hatred of landlords because they see them as the people who get all the houses, leaving none for them to purchase

3.) Wish harm upon landlords, the “gatekeepers of housing” and congregate in various forums/communities to speak ill of them and describe all the disgusting heinous shit they want to happen to them (seriously, check out some of the anti-landlord subreddits, they call all landlords names like pigs/leeches, and venerate people like Mao Zedong by saying shit like “Mao was right”. Yes, that same Mao that lead the slaughter of landlords in China. Also the same Mao who would ironically become China’s biggest landlord, but we don’t talk about that)

4.) Could have housing if they just lowered their standards, worked on their finances, or just rented. For example, maybe they should stop trying to buy in an HCOL area. They could move to a cheaper state or even country. Or, if they’re really deadset on a certain housing market, they could work harder, try to make a business, or pivot into an industry that pays more. This is not a guarantee that that dreamhouse will eventually become affordable, but if they don’t end up with that house, hey, at least they’re in a better position to find a nice house even if whereever/whatever it is isn’t your “first choice”. Or just rent! There’s nothing wrong with renting forever. 

Home-ownership has never been a fundamental human right. Access to shelter is, and in most cases they are not being denied this. They’re being denied access to shelter/housing in “nice” communities/neighborhoods, but nobody is entitled to live in a specific place. It sucks that they can’t participate in their preferred housing market, but believe me when I say there are probably thousands more in their price range. Don’t just think in terms of your state/country, think globally!

Think about that next time you condemn anyone. Think about how there's a little piece of that evil in you. Think about how given the right circumstances, you'd do just the same thing you demonize.

Edit:

Here is some information backing up my post.

**Stanford Prison Experiment.**
https://www.prisonexp.org/the-story

Shows that people zeolously slip into roles of power and abuse it.

**Milgram Experiment.**
https://www.simplypsychology.org/milgram.html

Shows that the *majority* of people will blindly follow an authority figure.

**The bystander effect**
https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/bystander-effect/

Shows that within a herd, everyone assumes responsibility isn't their own.

**Salem Witch Trials**
https://www.salem.org/salem-witch-trials/

Shows how people, when confronted with confounding experience, will point the finger and kill the dubbed source of the issue. Even when it makes no sense. To top it off, they chose women. As if they haven't been abused enough by that point in time shm

**WW2**
https://www.secondworldwarhistory.com/world-war-2-statistics.php

This showed that millions of people are willing to murder, rape, and loot simply because they were allowed to. It shows how seeming normal, good, everyday people can suddenly become violent monsters.

You guys think I'm being edgy. I'm just pointing out that while the majority of you *think* you would be part of the minority of people that actually do good, you are *not*. It doesnt take a genius to figure out why.

Critisims of my post:

**insults** - idc what you think

**some people were good back then. *I* would be good too** - tell me how it makes any fucking sense how a MAJORITY of people somehow believe they would be apart of the MINORITY of people that were actually good? It doesn't make sense. You are deluding yourself, and proving me right.

**my people were oppressed, how are we evil?** - being oppressed doesnt give you a free pass to being a good person. If power dynamics shifted, you'd just as quickly be the oppressor.

**I'm not that person, so it doesnt apply to me** - ya, it does. The whole point is that the capacity for evil is inside of you. You can absolutly be that person, and the only reason you arent is because you cant be. That doesnt make you a good person, it makes you powerless to do bad.

**nihilism bad = op bad** - I'm not a nihiliest because I'm able to point out people being fake ""good"". If anything I'm an absurdist.


Lastly, this isnt my philosophy or my sole perspective looking at the world. I'm just calling people out on their bullshit. I don't have a dOoMeR mentality. I see a lot of good things in the world too. Just because I made a post detailing the nasty part doesnt make me some nihilistic doomer asshat. You dont know me from this one post.

So he’s permanently disfigured one guy and raped a girl… that’s not something you can redeem yourself from not by a long shot. Rape someone and you should be known as a rapist forever period.

I've been trying to get a girlfriend for 7 months straight now, and I haven't even gotten close to getting one. I've joined dating apps a month and a half ago, and I have gotten nothing. It's becoming very obvious that women only want the same thing. A rich tall man who exudes pure confidence and can make everyone in the room laugh effortlessly.

That is the complete opposite of who I am. I'm just a broke college student who is very quiet and barely know my way around a joke. I'm 5'7 which is below average. Also it should be noted that my personality isn't a confidence thing, It's just who I am. It's how I am with my family, how i am with my best friend, and how I am alone. 

Why have I been setup for failure? I tried to deny it,  but it's becoming increasingly obvious, the incels are right. Women have set ridiculous standards and there is no way I can hope to reach them. The only time a girl has called me cute, is right before she ask me for money.

I didn't like Trump. I dislike Marjorie Taylor-Greene. I really dislike Mike Pence, the closet case homophobe.  

 But it is socially acceptable to say you dislike all of those people. They are reprehensible. It is not socially acceptable, however, to call AOC the embarrassment to the American people that she truly is.  

Every time I hear AOC speak, I lose brain cells. I feel like I am listening to a high schooler presenting a report full of idealistic proposals which are easily abandoned with a little bit of life experience. The Green New Deal is a colossal failure because it is impractical to assume that fossil fuels can be entirely replaced by renewable energy with no focus on nuclear. Guess what, Alexandria.. the sun isn't always shining, the wind is not always blowing, eventually there is no space to build dams on the rivers.   

It is absolutely hypocritical to claim that you are for ""taxing the rich"" while wearing a dress designed by someone who is known for tax evasion. It is hypocritical to claim the Right is trying to dictate who is and is not a woman when you cannot even define the word woman without using ""woman"" in the definition.   It is also hypocritical to claim to be against capitalism while you sell socialist-themed merchandise in your online store. Woke capitalism for the win!

Then there's the sheer, blatant narcissism. Anyone who criticizes the content of her views is accused of having a sexual or romantic infatuation with her, or is accused of ""cat-calling"" or being sexist/racist/etc. She has no ability to recognize that just maybe she is not always right. No, your criticism of her cannot possibly be because her ideas warrant being challenged... nope, you MUST be racist, sexist, or sexually obsessed. This way of thinking is a horrible one for any person, but to have a member of US Congress stating these things in the media for not only other Americans but the entire world to read is just embarrassing. She is so absorbed into the celebrity cult of personality of her role, not realizing her job is to serve the people of the US rather than act like life is a reality show.  

I cannot wait for the day that her narcissism and hubris get the better of her and she runs for the House of Representatives or for the Presidency, and receives a swift wake-up call that outside of her district, most Americans do not believe that renewable energy can supplement fossil fuels entirely, that the Senate should be abolished, that Israel is the embodiment of evil but we should be silent on Turkey/Russia/Saudi Arabia/etc., that there are an unlimited number of genders, that any criticism of a person of color constitutes racism or sexual obsession, or that the Federal Government is qualified to administer healthcare.

For a 15-year-old, this is a great message, but for kids, it's problematic, because 5-year-olds shouldn't be thinking about rebelling. Children of that age simply don't know what's best.

I also think the plot was really disappointing. The dad's conversation with Mei Mei had great potential to shake up the plot, but it ended up being a dead-end. It would have been much better if the big argument the mom had with her mom to be about Mei Mei's mom originally wanting to keep her panda like Mei Mei, because this would add more depth and would provide balance between healthy rebellion and parents knowing what is best. It also would have been better if it was revealed that, if Mei Mei kept her panda, the whole family kept their pandas, thus proving that the parents had good reason for not letting her keep her pandas, but instead it was a shallow film about ""Asian parents bad"".

Canada jails - brutalizes slaughters, and terminates the bank accounts of the Populist Patriot Freedom Convoy and is doing oppression far more evil than Putin

Third reason is Canada has two tyrannical heads of state Justin Trudeau and Queen Elizabeth. Queen Elizabeth of the current Empresa of the Anglo Imperialist British Empire who owned slaves and murdered millions in the name of colonial capitalism. 

Canadian magistrates show themselves in clown courts saying black chicks who announce how they hate white people before attacking one aren't committing a hate crime. Canada lives in anarcho tyranny without domestic tranquility from amateur thugs or the RCMP.

18 is the age of consent because it's the age where it can reasonably be expected that someone, male or female, can understand the implications and potential effects of their actions, as well as being able to grasp the fact that other people may or may not have your best interests in mind. In other words, below 18 we as a society understand that social or emotional incompetence is natural and developmental, whereas after this it becomes a flaw of character if it persists.

With that in mind, it's entirely possible to not think in terms of laws and still go ""that 19 year old girl that's coming on to me? Fine! That 16 year old girl?

The deal had nothing to do with apartheid, and the lifetime income generated, depending which version of Errol’s story you believe, might pay for one or two Tesla Roadsters today.

**Elon musk’s threatening anti-union tweet:**

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998454539941367808](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998454539941367808)

“Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.”

The “Give up stock options for nothing” was possibly Elon believing that UAW is generally against stock options in compensation packages.

This first possibility is backed up by Elon in a Twitter reply two days later:

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999415738967277568](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999415738967277568)

Twitter user- “You took that out of context, he clarified that in a response where he believed that UAW does not allow union workers to own stock.”

Elon- “Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.”

And by a later Tesla statement:

“Elon’s tweet was simply a recognition of the fact that unlike Tesla, we’re not aware of a single UAW-represented automaker that provides stock options or restricted stock units to their production employees, and UAW organizers have consistently dismissed the value of Tesla equity as part of our compensation package,” Tesla said in a statement. “We fundamentally believe it’s critical that all employees be owners of Tesla so that everyone is on the same team, with all sharing in the company’s success.”

[https://uaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-UAW-Constitution.pdf](https://uaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-UAW-Constitution.pdf)

It is also entirely possible that this was a veiled threat, and a judge ruled it was in the proceeding court case. However, the court proceeding provided doesn’t offer an investigation into possible alternative interpretations of the tweet aside from a threat. It seems weird, however, maybe it was omitted from the document? I can’t find any convincing arguments within the preceding that prove it was a threat, however, this still remains a possibility.

**Elon musk is a union buster:**

Most of this circles around this court case:

[https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tesla-nlrb.pdf](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tesla-nlrb.pdf)

The take away’s are:

Elon musk had a meeting with two employees seeking a union. In the meeting, he expressed that unionizing would give the union itself a voice, not tesla employees, and invited them to attend a weekly safety committee to express their concerns. Elon then said, if the committee doesn’t work out, “we’ll give you your union”;

Five employees were passing out union leaflets in the facility's parking lot. Working independently of musk, multiple different security guards repeatedly asked them for their employee badges and to leave the premises. One guard expressed an anti-union settlement, and the employees finally left after an employee falsy claiming to be from hr talked with them directly. These actions are considered illegal, as the security guards were considered to have “actual or apparent authority to act on behalf of the party.”

My interpretation:

There is no proof or reason to believe they were acting directly under the authority of musk, however, this reflects poorly on tesla as a company. Throughout the document, it seems tesla, from the managers to workers generally have hostile anti-union stances independent of musk himself and acted autonomously to intervene in a small but legal rally. Musk is seemly not guilty of suppressing unions, but instead, negligence in properly educating his employees about the rights of fellow employees/ properly enforcing said rights.

Next, two members of the protest were later found to have taken information on pro-union employee’s salary from an app used at the plant and published it on a private Facebook page.

Inciting report:

“During this conversation, Pratt told Gecewich that he sent the Facebook post to Hedges and had received the information from employee Bryan Kostich (Kostich) (Tr. 1086). Pratt told Gecewich that the Facebook post was from a Facebook page called, “Fair Future at Tesla” (Tr. 1086). Gecewich testified that Pratt told him that he thought the information in the Facebook post was inappropriate as it included how much money employees made at Respondent, and Pratt thought that he was being singled out (Tr. 1807–1808). Pratt complained that he felt uncomfortable with Ortiz speculating how much he made as well as the posting of his name and picture (Tr. 1807–1808).”

Ortiz’s Interrogation:

Gecewich started the meeting by asking about the Workday profile screenshots on the Facebook post. Gecewich and Ortiz then had a conversation about where the screenshots came from. Ortiz eventually admitted that it must have been Moran who sent the screenshots to him via text message but that he had received these screenshots from others as well (Tr. 530, 1842). Apparently prior to his meeting with Gecewich, Moran spoke to Ortiz about his meeting with Gecewich. During this meeting with Gecewich, Ortiz expressed concern about being fired and was worried in the prior meeting that he would be fired. Ortiz also spoke about his nature not to bring others into his own problems, and that he was protecting other employees including Moran (Tr. 1842–1844). By the end of this meeting, Ortiz had told Gecewich from where the photos had come.

The stated reason for termination:

After these meetings with Ortiz and Moran, Gecewich drafted a report of his investigation with recommended actions (Tr. 1846, 1850). Gecewich testified that he based his recommendations on looking at similar cases as well as the “unique facts of this case” (Tr. 1851). Gecewich testified that he considered Workday profile photos and any Workday screenshots to be sensitive; Gecewich’s characterization of the Workday photos or screenshots is based on his own belief that Workday is an internal data system (Tr. 1935). During his investigation, Gecewich claimed he never sought to learn what happened in Sacramento, went to the Facebook page to look at the page and never found out who were the members of the Facebook group (Tr. 1823, 1835). After drafting the report, Gecewich showed it to Tesla’s in-house counsel (Tr. 1849). Gecewich’s recommendation for termination of Ortiz and warning for Moran were “aligned with legal” (Tr. 1930). But a prior version of his report shows that Gecewich along with in-house counsel edited the investigatory report which was originally created on October 12 (GC Exh. 85). In a prior version of this report, Gecewich wrote, “This time frame corresponds to when these three Tesla employees went to Sacramento, California to speak with State legislatures about on behalf of Tesla” (Tr. 2201)

Ortiz’s termination:

McIntosh testified that Gecewich began the meeting by informing Ortiz that the investigation he had conducted was closed (Tr. 2066). According to McIntosh, Gecewich told Ortiz that he was found to be dishonest during the process as he was not forthcoming about some images or where the images came from and recommended termination.

My personal interpretation of events:

A tesla manager fired an employee unlawfully and tesla's legal council okayed the termination based on what said manager provided them. Again reflects poorly on tesla, however, there is no concrete evidence that Elon musk was directly involved in said firing or that the firing was covertly because of Ortiz’s attempts at unionizing. Any claims of union-busting fall into the realm of speculation, and if so are likely solely Cecewich’s personal motives. My speculation is that Elon Musk was not directly involved in Ortiz’s firing, and especially not on the basis of Ortiz’s pro-union stances. Ortiz and his five supporters are a vast minority of the plant's 10,000 and likely wouldn’t have gained traction in such an anti-union work culture. I personally do not see any reason Elon musk would go out of his way to have Ortiz fired other than pure spite, which is possible but unlikely.

**Tesla uses cobalt sourced from mines that utilize child labor:**

[https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN23U20Q](https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN23U20Q)

The vast majority of the world's cobalt comes from the congo where child slavery is frequently used. Tesla has taken a step forward to ensure its batteries are more socially responsible and a step back. Firstly they are attempting to shift away from using cobalt in their batteries, using a more advanced version of Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries starting in their Chinese market. However, In order to ensure a steady supply of cobalt while they make this transition, they’ve entered an exclusive deal with Glencore. The company is known as one of the more ethical cobalt suppliers however in spite of this there is still evidence of child labor within Glencore’s supply lines: [https://freedomcollaborative.org/newsletter-archive/a-swiss-company-profits-from-child-labour-and-perilous-conditions-in-a-bolivian-mine](https://freedomcollaborative.org/newsletter-archive/a-swiss-company-profits-from-child-labour-and-perilous-conditions-in-a-bolivian-mine)

Analysis:

It seems Tesla is attempting to faze out cobalt use as much as they can without affecting their profit margins. Clearly, the continual use of it is still immoral and this is a valid criticism of Musk and Tesla, However, Tesla isn’t as utterly uncaring about the issue as people claim.

Elon musk tax evasion:

Math is simple, most of Elon's net worth is tesla stock which is considered unrealized gains and isn’t taxed which explains the discrepancy between his net worth and taxes. If you owned stocks, bitcoin, or any other asset that can increase in value then you wouldn’t pay taxes on it either. The reason he didn't pay taxes in 2018 is that he accidentally overpaid in 2017.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777EFE1860>

230,ty45kj,Minorities who vote Republican should not mistake Individualism and Personal Responsibility for denigrating and insulting the rest of their communities they're supposed to represent.,StatisticianGreat514,1649303065.0,0,0.35,29,"No one wants to be labeled negatively for their views, especially in the political atmosphere. Furthermore, no one wants to be labeled negatively for their political views when it's mostly considered an anomaly in their communities. This argument obviously applies to minorities, particularly racial, ethnic, and religious who vote Republican and not Democrat. When they usually do that, they're labeled as Uncle Toms, sellouts, etc. In particular, these terms are mostly applied to Blacks, but they're also labeled towards others as well. The reason is that their critics view the Republican Party as detrimental in their eyes in terms of race, gender, religion, etc. This has led to a lot of Conservatives to call the people who use such terms as racists. I overall agree that no one should label someone who has different views as you by a certain expression. You can debate them but it shouldn't get to the point that you have to start name-calling. That being said, there's an obvious reason why they use these terms and for the most part, they do have a legitimate point. If they want this to stop, this is what Minority Conservatives need to do to prevent it from continuing.

Let's start off by saying that individualism and personal responsibility are overall great notions. No one wants to live a life of being a victim and being dependent all the time. Everyone wants to be successful. But what happens if it gets to a point that you make blanket statements associating negative stereotypes with the broader community that you're supposed to uplift and inspire so they can succeed just as much as you do? Obviously, people will get offended and you will be rightfully called out for it. As a result, you will not be considered a great role model in their eyes.

The above argument is an example of the trap that many Minority Conservatives fall into. They use personal responsibility and individualism by making themselves look morally superior to others. This results in them constantly bashing their community by associating negative stereotypes about them, including people who don't fit such stereotypes. They say things like they have a victim or plantation mentality, are obsessed with complaining all the time, are lazy, incompetent, want freebies, and constantly make poor choices like committing crime, doing drugs, skipping school, joining gangs, having out-of-wedlock children, etc. That is why they're always unsuccessful. With that type of condescending attitude, how do you think you'll win over your community like that? Furthermore, they and the majority of their fellow Conservatives (majority of them being White) view Minorities through the lens of poverty if they vote Democrat and if they're successful, work hard, do well in school, have a decent income, have a strong family background, avoid gang activity, don't use drugs, etc., they vote Republican. There are a lot of successful minorities in America who fit all these categories and they don't vote Republican. Furthermore, there are a lot of prosperous Middle and Upper-Class neighborhoods and suburbs in America populated by minorities who tend to lean Democrat. What do they have to say about that? Are they existent to them or not? Because it doesn't sound like they are.

Another argument that I want to make in regards to the statement I wrote above is that Conservatives will be the first to accuse Liberals of thinking minorities are a monolith who should think one way. But what they fail to realize is that they're doing the exact same thing. The Minority Conservatives are just as guilty of doing that as well. In fact, they're the repeat offenders of it. Overall, they think that the minorities are incapable of thinking for themselves. I really can't help but ask them if they see the hilarious and blatant irony in their arguments cause it seems like they don't. But hey, projection is their jam.

To close off, my message to all the current and incoming Minority Conservatives is this: If you don't want to be called Uncle Tom, don't mistake Personal Responsibility and Individualism for putting down your own race, religion, etc. in order to gain acceptance from the majority, let alone the minority. It doesn't matter if you're White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, etc. It's cringeworthy and surprisingly enough, it's considered an example of shameless pandering. Not only that, you're creating new stereotypes of your demographic that are just as bad as the ones you claim to be against. We all know how you and the rest of your fellow White Conservatives love to criticize Liberal-leaning Whites for being self-loathing and having White Guilt and going further by referring to them as cucks, beta males, soyboys, girly boys, brown nosers, coal burners, etc. (all of which are similar in context to Uncle Tom and should be dubbed racist as well). I agree, it's just as cringeworthy. But that doesn't mean you should accept Minority Self-Loathing as well as Minority Guilt either, whether it be Black Guilt, Hispanic Guilt, Jewish Guilt, and Muslim Guilt. If you really want to bring change, don't be condescending to your audience. You're meant to be role models not grifters. And since Conservatives claim to not see color and see individualism, don't generalize your audience as a whole. Many of the Conservative outlets that you supposedly follow like Fox News and Breitbart have a tendency of looking down on minorities and generalizing them a lot instead of viewing them as individuals as they claim to believe, in particular the former when it comes to crime committed by minorities. An obvious example being ""13%"". It definitely is possible to be a Minority Conservative while not being a total and complete sellout.

236,txi3n4,people will start hating Ukraine soon after the war is over just like Israel,jonyprepperisrael,1649236932.0,6,0.67,8," 

Before I start I want to say something: I am an Israeli, and half Jewish Ukrainian from my father side who was born in Ukraine and his mother being a holocaust survivor. I do not hate Ukraine or the Ukrainian people, nor do I hate Russia or the Russian people. This isn't about me hating Ukraine, but it does about me seeing what the likely future will be for Ukraine. I could be wrong, but you know.  


Here's what I think will happened:

If, and its a big if, Ukraine does get Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea back people will start complain about Ukraine the same way they do on Israel and the west bank.

Yesterday, Zelensky said in an interview that Ukraine will become a big Israel and not like the liberal western European countries.

What he meant by this was that Ukraine will start to militarize and develop its own weaponry that fits its needs as well as start doing policies like mandatory service, big defense budget etc.

But what will also happened is that Ukrainian society will also become much alike Israeli society. I wont go over about everything it means but for our purpose this means that Ukrainian society will be more acceptable towards losing liberties if it means security, and it makes since because we Israelis were too willing to give up on liberties like with the mandatory service in the IDF because it means that our country will be safe, that what he meant by not wanting to be liberal western country.

And another thing that will happened to Ukrainian society is that it will become more paranoid, after all, it was Russian citizens from your country who revolted and joined sides with Russia and those separatists were Russians, and I dont really think anyone gonna mind the amount of Russians who did not support the separatists, because after all, if they wanted to live in Ukraine they should have packed their bags and migrated to their country. They would pretty much give the ""compliance is soft support"" like they did with the Russians who live in Russia and dont overthrow their government since you know, they revolted and overthrew their government back in 2014. This isn't me saying that Ukrainian society will be racist, its just it will be more of ""respect and suspect"" kind of deal, like we have with the non Bedouin Israeli Arabs.

So what will happened? Well, first there will be marshal law across those liberated places, then, the population will be under surveillance and be suspected in case they ever try to separate again, which could happened since any separatist with luck that had managed to run way before hand will most likely be a terrorist and attack across the border like the Palestinian Fedayeen. Next, the Russian speaking population will start to feel antagonized and would wish for Russian liberation back again, or better yet they would form their own nationalism that is distinct enough from Ukraine and Russia. Golda Meir said that Palestinians dont exist but she was half true at her time, those countries in the middle east has only existed for around 20-30 years at this point and only existed cause a European diplomat said so.

Next, those liberated areas will start harboring terrorist organizations disguised as Russian liberation organization or LLO if you want. A situation that will force the Ukrainian army to deploy troops there to arrest and eliminate those terrorist cells, and since this is soldiers v terrorists in urban environment, civilians will get killed. Ukrainian soldier killed them? Terrorist? Doesn't matter he's a martyr from now on.

All these things and more will probably lead to a Russian intifada, that will force Ukraine to go hard against those terrorists, and if a peace deal is ever made with that LLO, it would probably be sort lived as this deal will only give whoever in charge of that LLO a cover for any illegal activities he might want to do.

And we forgot about Ukrainian people, who some will probably migrate back to these regions, putting them in conflict with the local population who would look at them as settlers that try to destroy the identity of the region.

And add to that the fact that Russia, while weak diplomatically, could still recover from this war and gain allies diplomatically, allies that could antagonize Ukraine in the UN. Not to mention all the propaganda it still could employ, showing pics of dead children in Donetsk and saying ""this is what Ukrainian troops do"" while completely ignoring the fact there was an ambush of Russian terrorists on Ukrainian soldiers who caused a stray bullet to kill the kid.

And you wondering how will the people of Ukraine will react to all of these? The same way we react in Israel. When we hear news about dead terrorist in Jenin we celebrate that a massacre has been avoided, when we think about the soldiers in the west bank we think of the separation wall (which is actually most just fence but still) we think of the fact that after construction it lowered the terrorists attack rate by 90% When we remember the disengagement from Gaza with all these settlers we think that they were, for a lack of a better term, ungrateful bastards who elected a terrorist group that shouldn't have been on the ballot in the first place, a group that launched rockets at our cities from hospitals and schools, which makes it even harder to pull the trigger when it comes to air strikes, heck we had to invent roof knocking with bombs.

And why can we put up with all this things like mandatory service, the government being able to see what's on your phone at any time, delays of security when going to the airport? High budget for the armed forces? Any killing of Palestinians (innocent or guilty) Because in our society, that will soon become Ukrainian society too, security is above all else, because its better to be safe now and sorry later, because you cannot allow yourself to lose the next war because then you wont even have a country.

So now you got all of these factors, all the terrorism, nationalistic people that want security, propaganda machine of Russia, separatists who wished to break away. And now tell me reddit wont flood with ""free Donetsk"" And Al Jazeera will call for Zelensky to be brought to the Hauge.

the internet will call out Ukraine as an apartheid for not letting Russians, who I should remind you were separatists not so long ago, be completely free and that they should ""break the chains"".

And Putin and Russia? Well, I dont hear much about sanctions against most middle eastern nations when it comes to their human right records.

Your entire conception of the world is built around the need to control land and resources. Nothing else matters and many battles are fought over it. You don’t have time to think about smaller populations and what their concerns might be. The bottom line is: if you have more people than them and are confident in your ability to oust them, you do it, because you need that land.  
  
It’s only later, once all land is conquered and various peace treaties have been established that you start to see great art and culture develop. And you can look back at the prior times of brutality and aggression feeling slightly bemused. How could people have simply trampled over those poor communities? Why were they so obsessed with power and dominance? Can’t we all just get along?  
  
The point is: you can only really understand the times in which you live. You can’t know what it’s like to live in a society where it’s fundamental purpose is completely different to your own.

246,twgpmd,Parents using verbal rebuke and emotional withdrawal is NOT abuse.,,1649115311.0,0,0.15,12,"One of parents' main jobs is to prepare their child for the real world...

Since this is the case, parents should emotionally and psychologically abuse their children.

One clarification:

I am completely against any and all forms of physical abuse (corporal punishment), including spanking. In the real world, there is (almost) NEVER a situation where the child would get hit or physically punished.

**BUT, in the real world...**

* **Children WILL be subjected to verbal abuse.** *Examples: Angry boss or angry customer yells at employee. Friends get into a nasty verbal disagreement. Some guy cuts another driver off and curses him out.*
* **Children will be subjected to emotional abuse.** *Examples: Manipulative girlfriend toys with boyfriend's emotions. Husband cheats on wife. Friend of 30 years stabs best friend in the back for monetary gain.*

**To prepare their children for the real world, parents SHOULD subject their child to (at least a little) verbal abuse and emotional abuse.**

Verbal abuse can simply be the parent screaming and shouting at their child when the child misbehaves. (Many people nowadays consider that unacceptable or even abusive, but I disagree.)

Emotional abuse can manifest itself as the parent occasionally telling their child that it is worthless and a waste of space. (Many people would call that abusive language, but I strongly feel it is necessary to prepare the child for what others might say in the real world.)

**On a personal note:**

One of the greatest lessons my father EVER taught me occurred when I was a younger child.

*I asked him, ""Dad, do you love me unconditionally?""*

*He told me, ""There is NO such thing as unconditional love. Get used to it!""*

I had not done anything wrong before that interaction, BUT his candor and tough love really allowed me to gain a clear understanding of how cold a place the world can be. **And I think that short interaction with my Dad has prepared me WELL for life.**",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777F39B588>

I am 20 years old and a light cigarette smoker (1 pack per week). I completely cut pornography out of my life and I can confirm that my non-smoking friends who watch pornography are all much less socially adjusted, less confident, less mentally healthy and even less physically healthy than I am. Their skin is worse than mine, they are academically less successful and their are generally overweight.

I understand that smoking of cigarettes has been linked to various ailments but pornography is certainly the greater evil, judging by its impacts on people in my own life. Most rapists and serial killers are consumers of pornography. For example, Wayne Couzens was a police officer in my country who murdered an innocent woman, and it was later proven that he and his friends routinely consumed violent porn.

In the 1950s, when pornography was much lighter and much harder to access than today, and when most men smoked cigarettes, the streets were safe. Women felt safe going out at night, these days many women don't and this is because of how pornography affects the brain (just to clarify I'm not saying that women who watch porn are more afraid of it, more that there are more violent rapists and murderers out there today because men who watch porn are more likely to commit these acts due to how the porn affects their brains).

We have been conditioned to want a materialistic, shallow, and hypercapitalist lifestyle and world order by propaganda from plutocratic states and megacorporations.

We do not have real democracy, certainly not where I live in the US, and not even really in Europe. Democracy requires true equality, which no modern capitalist ""democracy"" possesses, by virtue of the fact every country, even the relatively ""egalitarian"" Scandinavian social democracies, have people far wealthier and disproportionately influential than any others. In the US, it is absurd to claim we have ""democracy"" when the two-party system is little more than a neoliberal puppet of the capitalist class; the idea the average citizen, no matter how thoughtful or rational their ideas are, has any chance of being acknowledged on anything more than a token handshake or vague and empty response from his representative's staffers, is absurd. Don't get me wrong, I love our constitutional civil liberties, but time and time again, we see these rights—even when the constitution is very clear from a frank and common-sense perspective—be ignored or rationalized away if they are too inconvenient for the ruling class: NSA warrantless mass surveillance, internal border checkpoints, bans on civilian ownership of fully-automatic weapons (""shall not be infringed""), solitary confinement and other torture (""cruel and unusual punishment""), perpetual copyright, de facto wars without congressional approval, and holding prisoners without trial, all of these are very clearly unconstitutional to anyone with high school education in the English language who is being honest to themselves, yet all are rationalized and excused away be the courts nonetheless. Why? Because an entrenched elite *always* continually accumulates more and more power, and civil liberties, by there very nature liberties *the government* ""guarantees"" to not infringe, are inherently on very shaky ground. This is true of every state society, including Iceland, New Zealand, Sweden, and other societies we think of as near perfect democracies. Guess what? Wiemar Germany and Chile under Allende were ""thriving constitutional democracies, ""and yet they too fell to brutal dictatorial thugs.

An example of a true democracy would be the Iroquoian confederacies of the Northeastearn Woodlands prior to European destruction: Lack of significant financial inequality, a class system, presence of regular community meetings between true equals, and perhaps most importantly, the right to leave one's community or disobey orders from the Sachem or Clan Mother. Yes, there were exceptions to these rules, such as the Mourning Wars where captives were taken, and a maniac would be restrained or probably killed if s/he caused danger or severe disturbance. Obviously their societies were hardly perfect, but then you can note South Korea is hardly perfect from the standpoint of a truly democratic society, yet for a North Korean it would seem almost unimaginably good by comparison. But the Wyandot, Iroquois, and Neutral Nations had no prisons, no entrenched class system, and no significant economic inequality. No Iroquoian man, woman, or child had to worry about being evicted from their home if they couldn't pay rent, suck up to a boss they hate because they have to pay back their student loan debts. And while the False Face Society was very secretive, unlike the NSA, the KGB, or MI5 members of the False Face Society weren't constantly watching you in your longhouse, when you went hunting, or listening to your conversations with your family or friends. And the False Face Society—or indeed, the Grand Council itself—didn't force you to fork over 30% of your corn crop or catch in deer meat every year and send heavily-armed men to drag you out of your corn field when you least expected it and put you in a cage if you refused, and if you physically resisted these heavily-armed men you wouldn't be locked up in the cage for still longer or even killed on the spot.

To live in a world without this oppression, you need to get rid of centralization. Centralization isn't just in the state; our economic and technological system, by virtue of the phenomenal level of specialization and resources required to make modern electronics,  which modern aircraft, automobiles, agriculture, energy grids, factories, food production—including so called ""green"" foods like Beyond and Impossible Ersatz meat—requires centralization. Centralization inherently breeds hierarchy, and hence we'd be back to being slaves of the ruling class and the state, maybe in some different form, i.e. right-libertarian corporatocracy or a quasi-pharoanic religious autocracy, but it will *inevitably* reemerge.

One of the most iron laws of history is this: Every time a leader or small elite are trusted with power, especially when massive amounts of theorizing and selecting the ""benevolent"" monarch or dictator, or ""strong"" checks and balances, things will return to a similarly highly unequal, unjust, and rigged system as the old one in time, unless the new system becomes even worse. The only societal systems which truly work over the long-term are stateless societies: Witness Native Californians, Australian Aborigines, Iroquoian and Algonquian peoples, and Khoisan bands in Southern Africa. Or, the longevity of modern Pueblo villages compared to the brief glory and then collapse of the Chacoan regime.

In time, if we don't stop this ship from sailing into the rock, it *will* be too late, because technology *will* become too advanced to stop. Which brings me to my last, and perhaps gravest, concern: AI. In the times of the Haitian Revolution, if enough people got really really mad, the weapons of the elite were not so overwhelmingly superior a mass of the poor, working class, and underclasses could simply overpower them. Also, surveillance in even the most despotic preindustrial states pales in comparison to the what your boss can see on ""your"" company phone from his desk at work, let alone the truly behemoth power of the supercomputers of modern militaries and intelligence agencies. AI will either lead to one or two outcomes, probably both, in order: It will enable a totalitarian system where the elite enjoy near absolute power and luxury; and/or it will ultimately overthrow *all* mankind, and possibly destroy all life on Earth in an endless quest for resources, depending on its fundamentally inhumane motives.

The only long term solution I can see is this: We have to overthrow the techno-capitalist system and adopt a stateless, sustainable agrarian system of societies the world over. This system will not be uniform, far from it. I can easily see dry coastal areas being based on fisheries and aquaculture, not unlike what the Ancient Peruvians and Northwest Coast Peoples relied on; forest, wetland, and other well-watered areas being covered in vast forest gardens with many types of small livestock, fish, insects, and fungi being part of the local diets; dry and mediterranean areas being based on transhumance or clever irrigated agriculture, perhaps like the systems the Pueblo peoples have perfected over the centuries; boreal forests, tundra, and polar areas focused on reindeer or yak herding, low-input forest gardening systems, or hunter-gatherer ways.

I do not support returning to a purely hunter-gather existence. This is unjust, because it requires almost everyone on Earth to starve to death. It is a false dichotomy, because many ""hunter-gatherer"" cultures like the Owens Valley Paiute, California natives, and even Australian Aborigines (read *Dark Emu*) practised what was basically equivalent to agriculture, just not *European* field and monoculture-based agriculture. Not to mention many, *many* long-standing, largely egalitarian traditional societies which practised what is indisputably agriculture, such as the New Guineans, the Puebloans, Iroquoians, many Amazonian peoples, and peoples of the Matrilineal Belt of Africa.

This does not mean we should reject *all* technology. Traditional systems of irrigation, metallurgy, water and wind mills, paper, printing presses, concrete, etc. and other technologies are objectively different from modern petrol engines, jumbo jets, spacecraft, superalloys, or nanotechnology in that they can be very easily decentralized. To make concrete all that is needed is lime, aggregate, and baked clay—indeed, several traditional societies invented just this process. Ironworking is a hallmark of tribal Bantu Africa. Paper requires only fibre, water, and lye, the last of which can be easily obtained from burning seaweed, coastal plants, or certain trees.

We must make this transition now before it is too late. We must revitalize ourselves, and renew Mother Earth.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777F7EFDA0>

Next time you want to condemn antifa for political violence, just admit that you think your politcal violence if justified and stop pretending you can disavow political violence as a whole. 

The same problem occurs with the military and borders. Borders require politcal violence to exist. Most actions by militaries are terrorism, they are purposely enacted to create fear in their victims. Guantanamo bay, drone strikes, sanctions all accomplish this.

If you support capitalism, you are supporting constant propaganda in your daily life. Marketing and advertising is just a lighter way of saying propaganda. Advertisements are psychologically designed for you to perform an action you wouldn't have otherwise. It's only gotten worse as capitalism has advanced.

273,trulrx,cats are 10x better than dogs and deserve more respect,awkpixie,1648602218.0,17,0.69,36,"(tried to post this on r/ unpopularopinion but they flagged it and said it was just me complaining about ""daily annoyances"" even though i'd actually love to hear other people's perspectives on this. and it's not an annoyance lol it's a debate/unpopular opinion. i knew i should've posted it here, just thought i'd at least try the other subreddit first. my mistake).

i am a cat person, and for good reason. don't get me wrong, i like dogs and i've even grown to love some. but when it comes down to it, i hold more respect and love for cats than i think i ever could for dogs.

here's why...

- cats are cleaner. they clean themselves, and nearly never need a bath. they aren't as rowdy and don't get themselves into nearly as many messes as dogs do. and they also don't usually smell at all (unless you have a bunch of them together, obviously that will accumulate a smell).
- they're not nearly as codependent as dogs. they don't need attention 24/7, daily walks, or constant play time. they'll come to you when they desire your attention, and it's usually a fair amount before they want to be left alone again, so you're not being hassled all the time.
- they're practically potty trained from the start. majority of cats only need to be directed to the litter box once or twice as kittens, and from then on they needn't be reminded again. they're also just easier to train in many ways (from mine and many others' experiences).
- they're great exterminators! cats will chase and kill just about any bug or rodent you have around your home.
- they're extremely smart. there's been debate about whether cats or dogs are smarter - and while the studies have come up as inconclusive, from my personal experience with cats and dogs, cats are smarter. while dogs, scientifically, do have more neurons than cats have in their brain, that can mostly be accredited to the fact that dogs were bred and genetically modified to be the way that they are today. it's also not known whether dogs actually *use* the full capacity of their brain. whereas cats have evolved and adapted to society and the environment almost entirely on their own. cats also have a much stronger ability to adapt to nature than dogs do. they can climb, hunt, hide, and survive in ways that a dog cannot. cats are also independent - while they *can* get along in packs, they can also survive on their own. the same cannot be said for dogs, who are known to be pack animals. they show more intelligience, more cleverness, and more adaptability than dogs do in so many ways.
- cats can endure more. it's well known that's cats are more flexible and can land on their feet. they can jump from higher places, run and crawl through tighter spaces, etc. (however i will say that *because* they're able to handle riskier manuevers, it could make them more susceptible to injuries).
- cats are neglected (mostly) because of dogs. you wanna know why you see so many stray cats on the streets? why you may happen across cats that have been hit by cars far more than dogs? because people prefer dogs. because dogs, for a particular reason, are viewed as ""better."" i've seen so many people say that ""if you're not a dog person then you're a psychopath."" and there's also so many negative stigmas surrounding cat lovers aka ""the crazy cat lady"" or ""witches and cats"" etc. people adopt and breed dogs endlessly, while cats are left out on the streets to fend for themselves. but honestly, i see more red flags with being a dog person. dogs are some of, if not *the* *most* submissive animals on the planet. they cater to your every demand, they flood you with attention and love, they submit to you in every way, they struggle to learn boundaries - and they've been genetically designed to be this way... to submit to humans. im sorry, but it's **weird.** if you hate cats because they're independent and think for themselves, then in my opinion *that's* more alarming... to hate something that doesn't submit to you.

- (EDIT) dogs pose a bigger threat to humans. their bites are stronger, and when aggressive they can actually severely injure and even *kill* people. i've seen so many articles and news clips of dogs attacking, injuring, and killing humans. i've even heard of a dog biting off a toddler's arm, or a pack of dogs dragging someone into a ditch and chewing off their face. dogs are more violent, and some are even bred to be fighters. i've personally witnessed multiple dogs become aggressive and bite or slash open their owners, and other people around them, to the point of drawing blood and punching holes into the people's skin with their teeth.

all around cats are just better in so many ways.

EDIT: to those of you bringing up the brain fungus argument, more than a third of the world population has this brain fungus you speak of. studies have shown that most, nearly all, people who have this brain fungus are not affected by it at all. and cat owners aren't the only ones who have it.

from an article on inverse, ""These findings go far beyond cat lovers. Researchers say understanding microglia's defense capabilities could lead to better ways of treating other brain infections, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, and autoimmune disorders, like multiple sclerosis and strokes."" so this brain fungus, and our ability to fight it, is actually helping researchers and scientists be able to study and better understand other neurological diseases/ailments that need a cure.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777F9394E0>

275,tr8mvu,The people who accuse others of being sheep are in reality the biggest sheep of them all.,StatisticianGreat514,1648572745.0,8,0.6,23,"This opinion obviously applies to the current situation we have regarding COVID-19. With many precautions being implemented over the past several months in order to combat the virus, there's been some people out there who think they are so entitled to dismiss the severity of it, whether it be masks, vaccines, mandates, social distancing, etc. Instead, they claim to rely on their immune system, which in my opinion isn't really enough to combat it and it shows. As a result, they resort to calling those who heed to such precautions as sheep and lab rats. They even go further by harassing and threatening doctors who do their job to help cure patients affected by it as well as parents who decide to mask their children as child-abusers to comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust. And for the most part, these people obviously tend to be Conservative and are unvaccinated. But at the end of the day, who is getting affected and dying? The Unvaccinated or Vaccinated? The answer for the most part is the Unvaccinated. Why do you think that is? Obviously because they're constantly being fed propaganda and misinformation. Now, these people are suffering the consequences of their actions and their friends and family suffer as well. If anything, it seems to me that these people are the real sheep not the ones who they constantly accuse of. These are the same people who also for the most part don't tend to take any personal responsibility, especially since I mentioned before, the victims are mostly Conservative and personal responsibility is one of its main tenets. In conclusion, the real sheep who are being sent to the slaughter are the unvaccinated. Their constant obsession with owning the libs in the name of freedom have all but backfired. Hell, even our former president admitted that the unvaccinated are dying at a higher rate than those who are and he said it to a Conservative pundit straight to her face. He even got booed at a rally for taking the vaccine and even recommended his base to take it to no avail. Two examples that validate my opinion on this issue are Kelly Ernby and Robert Lamay.

Kelly Ernby, a former California prosecutor rallied against Covid vaccine precautions comparing it to socialism. She died of COVID complications in early January at the age of 46 setting off a chain reaction between the vax and antivax movements. Now, let's get to the next and main one: Robert Lamay. This death by far is one of the worst deaths of them both. This former Washington State Trooper had to retire early back in October due to his unvaccinated status and his criticism of the state's Democratic governor made him a viral sensation. He even had an interview with Fox News over it, which is pretty ironic since the studio has strict vaccine mandates themselves and 90% of their staff is vaccinated. This is clearly obvious over the fact that the interview he conducted with them took place in his squad car. Fast forward to February and he's dead as a doornail at age 50 from COVID and he leaves behind a wife and 4 children. Meanwhile, the studio for the most part remained silent.

So yeah, pretty much. The people who accuse others of being sheep are in reality the biggest sheep of them all. Now the question remains: Should we have empathy for them or not if they get affected and die? Obviously, we should. No death should be mocked. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be critical of them. We definitely should because they made a terrible and fatal mistake, one that was easily preventable and they need to be called out on that. Their deaths should also serve as a reminder of what could happen if others made the same mistake and to prevent it from happening. What's even frustrating is that the ignorance of these people is only making it harder to stop the virus. Like I said, personal responsibility and it goes both ways. Whether it be complying with the police as some people cry out, the same logic applies here. Furthermore, dying to own the Libs is not fighting for your freedom. It's fighting for stupidity. It also dramatically decreases your political base.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777F934E80>

2) Sports is about celebrating the best, the strongest, the fastest. If the female athletes winning gold medals were born men so be it. We shouldn't celebrate mediocrity by letting people who are ""too good"" not get a chance to shine.

3) Nobody cares about other biological factors giving certain groups advantages in athletics. Should freakishly naturally strong cis women be banned too?

4) Conservatives try to turn this into a government issue, passing laws barring trans people from playing sports.

However, I want to be absolutely clear when I say that Will and Jada Smith have received far more criticism than is warranted because of an unorthodox relationship. History will remember them as being ahead of the curve. Not every relationship needs to be polyamorous or open, but shitting on Will at every turn for HIS decision to stay with Jada is none of anyone's damn business, and it's completely unwarranted. 

The fact that people need to constantly draw attention to an extremely personal part of someone's life is not only sad, it's cowardly. People did this for years to Taylor Swift and Britney Spears, only for them to be vindicated years later. Calling Jada a whore is not only misogynistic, but I would argue that it has roots in racism as well. Charlie Sheen had a polyamorous relationship with his ""goddesses"" before his drug-fueled, egomaniacal downfall, but people's perception of him then was largely positive, and certainly never devolved into hurling slurs and lowbrow jokes at him.

the academy awards seems to be the only thing that reddit hates more than superhero movies. whenever I've made a post that involves the oscars, i\`ve gotten at least one comment about how the oscars ""don\`t matter"". earlier today, i made a post on [r/askreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/) wherein i asked the people of that sub what movie they think will win best picture tonight. one of the comments said ""as if i care"".

i really don\`t get why people on reddit seem to have such a hate boner for the oscars. yes, there are snubs and some wins are undeserved but that\`s the case with every award ceremony. i could say those same things about the grammies or the tonys or the eisners. everyone is going to have a different opinion. also, just because a movie won an award doesn\`t mean you have to like it. for example, i don\`t particularly care for shakespeare in love despite the fact that it won best picture. that\`s how opinions work. everyone has one and no two people\`s opinions will be exactly the same. or maybe it\`s because the oscars have pretty much become a dick measuring contest as to who\`s more liberal. i will admit that the virtue signaling in the oscar is a bit annoying(and that\`s coming from a liberal). however, all art is political to a certain extent and movies are art. yes, i could do without ""the police will kill three people"" but, in a world where pretty much all art is political, a bit of that is unavoidable.

i love the academy awards and i watch it every year. not only is it exciting to see movies that i really like be nominated for and even win awards, but there is a lot of emotion and enjoyment to be had. i am left awe struck at the performances from the musical artists and am left in tears after the in memorium segment. tonight, as i always have, i will tune in at 8:00 and will watch the ceremony in it\`s entirity. because i love the oscars.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777FB5FB00>

300,tpnvqc,YouTube's decision to hide downvotes makes sense,,1648399709.0,0,0.29,26,"Basically the title - I can think of many cases where it makes sense to hide (or even entirely disable) downvotes.

For one thing, consider Reddit itself - fully half of the super-downvoted posts I see have nothing wrong content-wise, the opinion just goes against the grain of the subreddit it is in, so pissy members downvote it into oblivion

On the other hand, I have personally made some super acerbic comments that by rights should have been downvoted, and yet were upvoted sky-high

Until people learn that the downvote button isn't the ""this hurt my feewings"" button (paging r/conservative), it can make sense to disable downvotes",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777FB9EA20>
301,tpcsib,"The ""don't say gay"" bill is a cruel attempt at making it so children are never exposed to the idea that it's ok to be gay or trans growing up",User7422,1648356686.0,3,0.52,166,"The bill doesn't just ban it up until third grade. Right after the text saying that, there's text saying,"" or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” The entire thing is deliberately written to be as vague and subjective as possible in order to scare teachers into never exposing children to the idea that gay people exist

Children are already exposed to the idea that straight people exist before third grade. The idea that that's ok but children finding out about the existence of LGBT people isn't, is hypocritical.

Travis Hutson gave the example of a math problem that includes the details that “Sally has two moms or Johnny has two dads.” Republican State Sen. Dennis Baxley, who sponsors the bill in the Senate, says that is “exactly” what the bill aims to prevent."" I am not advocating for children to get sex ed classes, I'm advocating for there to not being a law that makes it so teachers can't answer students questions and are forced to go out of there way to make sure that nothing students see has any mention of gay people existing

Also, since there's much more to being in love with someone then having sex with them, I don't think it's fair to say that the existence of gay, lesbian or bisexual people is inherently sexual

Edit Just to be clear, I agree that children shouldn't be learning about sex when they haven't even reached fourth grade. But I don't see hearing someone acknowlege the existence of LGBT people to be the same thing",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777FB095C0>

Let me preface this by saying I am completely straight and am attracted to women. However, the look of vaginas is a massive turnoff, it looks like an open wound and thinking about it bleeding every month, why would anyone want to put their mouth down there?

Anyway, boobs and ass are great. Vagina not so much

Edit: Since 98% of the comments are clearly missing the point of my post or calling me gay (or both), let me clarify dick and balls are not attractive in the slightest either

I didn’t mention the male genitalia because my post was about attraction to females, and how the vagina is really not a turn on for me, especially compared to other parts on a woman.

306,tp0fds,White people cannot be victims of racism.,TrippieJedd,1648321526.0,0,0.34,48,"A lot of people will to downvote this because this sub is a blatant white circle-jerk (just type in “white people” to the search field here and read all the racist post titles lol), but I’ll preface this by saying that those who disagree have a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of racism.

The most common argument towards this viewpoint is the appeal to the (Google) definition of the word racism. First off, citing the dictionary definition of a word is the weakest possible argument to make in literally any case and is laughable. I regret to inform you that it takes a little more effort than reading the first definition you see on Google to come up with a genuine understanding of any abstract concept. For those who love to appeal to the “definition of racism”, I submit to you the comprehensive meaning of the word as detailed by the [NASP](https://www.nasponline.org/x26830.xml). It is actually *you* who is changing definitions to fit your perspective, not the other way around.

Redditors argue ad nauseam that racism = discrimination on the basis of race, perceived racial superiority, etc. towards someone else. While half true, the most fundamental aspect of the concept is missing from this definition, resulting in a gross oversimplification that leaves us with a definition much more closely related to racial prejudice rather than racism. As per its sociological application, in order for prejudice to be considered racism, there must be a system and institutions in place with which the dominant group (whites) can benefit from and leverage power over minority or marginalized groups. This is readily observable in the U.S through our policies (Jim Crow, redlining, [the war on drugs](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/race-mass-incarceration-and-disastrous-war-drugs)), hiring practices, (applicants with stereotypically white names are hired more frequently over applicants with stereotypically black names, despite the same [qualifications](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)), the [police system](https://www.ppic.org/publication/racial-disparities-in-law-enforcement-stops/), and a laundry list of many others. 

This is the foundation on which racism and racist institutions are built— a system which whites have never suffered at the hands of and never will. And no, systemic racism and racism are no different. They are the same concept, as one cannot exist without the other. There absolutely cannot be any racism without a power dynamic in play. White people have not and will never experience obstacles or oppression at the macro-level to the degree that POC have. The [absence of power](https://www.aclrc.com/myth-of-reverse-racism) amounts to nothing more than an exchange of mean words. Prejudice? Yes. Discrimination? Sure. Racism? Not even close.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777FC82630>
