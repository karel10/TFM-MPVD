2,q9gnuy,"If there is really a 'new world order', the new world is not 'liberalism'",WaterDemonPhoenix,1634405851.0,5,0.61,39,"It's funny how some people think that there is a 'new world order' that wants everyone to be gay or whatever conspiracy theory people come up it. Maybe USA is gearing towards that, maybe even western nation, but definitely not the entire world. If that did happen, countries wouldn't be over taken by the Taliban. Countries wouldn't be upping their punishments on 'liberalism'.   
I just find the fear of 'liberalism' all very weird. I'm much scared of radical right wing Muslims than I am of the left. Don't get me wrong, left wing authoritarians that want to ban everything are very scary, but I'd say if they are a 99, the extreme conservatives (like Taliban) are a 100.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017716CA2518>

What I hate is games that are like Metal Gear Solid 5, or the countless Call of Duty games. They consist of separate missions, and everything reset after each mission. The only two games that ever pulled this off is the original Halo and the 2016 Doom, and that is just because the whole game mechanics of Halo and Doom lends itself to individual missions.

8,q953xr,People who still think that the United States is a prudish country(at least in context of the Western world) need to get a fucking grip,Cookiecuttermaxy,1634359623.0,14,0.7,22,"I think the first impressions that come to people's mind about the United States being a righteously prudish country are formed more thru media exposure and not actually thru living here. Also, by what metrics is Europe anymore sexually liberal? Porn is literally a black market in Poland, France has already considered limiting public access to nudist resorts, the UK awhile back banned skirts in public schools (didn't successfully get voted in, so its pointless citing that one), what about when Swedes took outrage to this kids' song about genitals themselves, while literally more Americans were actually showing support [see for yourself ](https://youtu.be/yo_kW2jp63Q)

Is America still to some degrees sexually repressive? Oh absolutely

But to what degree is the prudishness really in base American culture and not an influence from the puritans? Who LITERALLY CAME FROM BRITAIN 

Yeah I remember the nipple outrage in the Super Bowl, I remember when hardcore conservatives back in the 90s wanted to ban porn, along with video games,  I remember when far right puriniticals complained about a gay wedding cake(which I changed my stance on completely)

But guess what? America, is a land of diversity of thought. This is because we're not a democracy, but a republic (traditionally speaking anyway). Meanwhile how many counties in Europe still don't have gay marriage legalized or reformed into the system? Also, in what country did a rape conviction happen simply because a guy's condom slipped out of during sex?

13,q8lkun,"If you're a Christian, abortion is a definite net good",Caelus9,1634293658.0,0,0.45,115,"In Christian theology, we are all sinners, bound for hell because of our wicked ways. Thankfully, Jesus died, and for some reason, that means if we accept him as our saviour, our souls are saved. This is true no matter what you've done. You could've spent your life persecuting Christians, murdering, raping, molesting, any of the most evil crimes, but if you ask Jesus Christ for forgiveness and to be your saviour, you're heaven bound by his mercy.

However, one thing common in all the variants of Christianity I've seen is that fetuses, incapable of getting baptized or asking for forgiveness, go to heaven if they die, be it by miscarriage or abortion.

Because of this, we have two simple facts: if you, a non-Christian, get an abortion, you're no less hell-bound than if you didn't, so there's really no effect on where you'll end up, and if you later become Christian, you'll be going to heaven either way. Meanwhile, if you're aborted, you're definitely going to Heaven, while if you're born, there's a high chance, something like 68% if I recall, that you won't be Christian and will end up going to hell.

Hence, it's pretty clear: abortion is a net good. You're vastly reducing the fetuses chance of going to Hell and guaranteeing it heaven, at no cost to the mortal soul of the mother. The most objective good would be for a mother to have as many abortions as possible, as this creates the greatest number of souls that get to go to heaven and experience bliss, before eventually asking for forgiveness. Hell, even if God gets annoyed at this loophole and refuses to forgive the woman, one soul going to Hell for the dozens of aborted souls going to heaven far outweighs the cost.

This is all predicated on Christian theology being correct, of course, and falls away with out it, but it's an interesting argument I've never seen addressed.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017716956860>

20,q84vah,Trump is a Russian agent,dward_45,1634233694.0,3,0.56,20,"He was sent here to fan the flames of culture war, sow distrust in our democracy, and destroy our nation from within. This is my opinion, and I’m not pretending to have conclusive evidence, but here are the reasons why I believe this:

In 2016, his campaign officials and family members met with Russians in Trump tower for the purpose of exchanging “dirt” on his opponent. Whether anything came of this or not, the parties involved admit that the meeting occurred and didn’t deny what the purpose of the meeting was. It’s unlikely that this is the first time the two sides made contact. This meeting lines up with a pattern of behavior that either directly or indirectly supports the Russian agenda of weakening America from within. 

[Throughout 2016, Trump claimed the election would be rigged](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37673797.amp)

After his victory, he abandoned the election fraud claims and continued to work for Russia from the Oval Office. He supported Russia’s agenda abroad, withdrawing support for Ukraine and the Kurds. He also publicly supported Putin’s agenda and had a much less contentious relationship with Putin than any former president. 

While in office he criticizes free press. Anytime the media is critical of him, he calls it “fake news”. His campaign against the media is meant push people to listing to and trusting him (the government) for information, rather than the free press which does not have to respond to the government. He also wants to compel right-winged media to tailor their reports to not upset him, causing him to tell his supporters to change the channel. If the media has to concern itself with the president’s opinion before running a story, they are not free press anymore. Russian media responds to the government, American media has always only responded to one thing: money. 

Throughout his time in office and the election cycle (which doesn’t truly end for Trump, since he continues to do campaign-style rallies even outside of the normal election cycle) he campaigns on the idea that the other side will destroy the country, and specifically his supporters way of life, if he loses. He tells people they should fear being replaced by immigrants and those who want “diversity”. 

Also throughout 2019 and 2020, he regularly said that even after he wins, he should be allowed a 3rd term because of how “poorly he was treated”. Many people dismissed this as a joke, but there are many supporters who would only vote for him and would definitely support a 3rd term. He wants to remain in office as long as possible. 

In 2020, the election fraud claims came back and when he lost, he claimed the election was stolen from him. He told supporters to gather at the Capitol and convince congress to overturn the election, which is not something the rules allow them to do. All of his attempts to overturn the election from Election Day to January 6th would have been unconstitutional. 

Now, he sends out emails to his supporters saying that if we don’t “solve” the 2020 election fraud, republicans won’t vote in 2022 or 2024. This is a message to his supporters that there’s no reason to partake in American democracy, and a message to Republican politicians that if they don’t support his election fraud campaign, he will turn against them. He is also isolating members of the Republican Party who don’t believe the election was stolen, creating a party of people who don’t trust anyone in government or media besides him. 

He is currently holding “save America” rallies, entirely focused on the “issue” of solving the stolen 2020 election. All of his actions push us closer and closer to civil war. There are millions of people on the “right” who believe our country is already lost and democracy is broken, but that’s simply not true at this point. If we allowed him to have his way and Congress/Mike Pence unconstitutionally overturn the results of the election, their fears would have come true. 

The Cold War never ended, the battleground just changed. Russia is the same government that wants to be their region’s unopposed superpower, and America is still a roach for them that’s impossible to kill with violence or the threat of violence. What’s the best way to destroy the most diverse superpower in the world? Use that diversity against them and make them fight themselves. Re-ignite the flames of the Civil War and the unresolved conflicts between different factions. I’m confident that Trump isn’t the only Russian agent in our government, but he is certainly the most effective. He is by far the most polarizing figure in America today and the disruption he causes is exactly what the Russian government wants.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177168F7F98>

Unfortunately this type of behavior is being encouraged and is becoming increasingly more common.

26,q7r4o1,Males who are in favor of traditional gender roles don’t deserve custody of their kids,wigsnatcher42,1634181030.0,0,0.35,16,"Ive noticed that the men who complain the most about family courts siding with women, are always the same ones who view childrearing & housework as primarily women’s jobs.  They seek out motherly qualities in women, and prefer to be the ones that over see the big picture operations of having a family and focus on providing.  Meanwhile the wife deals with the kids directly.

Recently I was listening to a sort of RP guy complain that divorce courts are sexist because they only ask questions that favor women, like [fo one example] “what’s your kids teachers names” lol.  He also promotes grooming girls from birth to make motherhood their main priority.  This seems to echo the feelings of many RP, tradcon and general manosphere types.  

This didn’t make sense to me — if you believe women are best equipped for childrearing, why should the courts side in favor of a father who is not even involved in the kids education? For example.

If I’m a judge, and I have a man in front of me who believes parenting is primarily a woman’s job, I’d be inclined to believe him.

The logical answer is full custody to the woman.

tl;dr: If you’re traditional, don’t complain about divorce courts siding with women —  it’s only congruent with your previously established values.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177168A0940>

Well, sure, that's what I would say, that's the view of the non-woke majority, or if not majority then at least enough people for the debate that is going on around it to exist. And the fact that it is so heavily debated kinda disqualifies it, no? Idc if you call everyone who disagrees with you a bigot, something being politically correct doesn't magically make it empirically correct, period. And don't start with intersex people, it's an anomaly and thus it's fair for someone to not consider it a sex, plus you know damn well that's not what OP was referring to.

Or even vaccines. As a fully vaccinated, pro-vax person, seeing a post where somebody says ""vaccines bad"" and it being taken as the person being ""confidently incorrect"", well, I may believe they work, I may believe we have the data to support it, but as soon as there is even a terribly small chance that the vaccines are bad in one sense or another, which I believe there is (some people DO have a bad reaction, even ones I know), just shut up and don't post it there. It is not something that you can easily disprove such as spelling or math. Plus even if vaccines were the undisputed best thing in the world, to me it's the cheapest form of karma whoring out there.

I don't even care if this opinion fits this sub, I guess I just needed to vent.


tl;dr - if you honestly believe YOU are right about something, but there is even a small chance you are not, that could make you, well, confidently incorrect


Edit: changed ""that's what I believe"" to ""that's what I would say"" as some people correctly pointed out that there are in fact more than two sexes, so please give a bit more attention to the ""it's an anomaly and thus it's fair for someone to not consider it a sex""

44,q6jiqs,Doubting the existence of Jesus and James is anti-intellectual and bad history,IanArcad,1634036107.0,0,0.35,17,"##James

Did you know that Jesus had a brother, named James, who was the first bishop of an early Christian church, and who died by being stoned by a High Priest associated with King Herod?

How can we be sure of things that happened two thousand years ago?  Well, we have a lot of sources, including Roman historians and early multiple Christian authors.  At least a dozen.

In fact our problem isn't a lack of information it's too much really - one source says he was stoned, another stoned and beaten , and another just says he was beaten.  There's also some confusion because there was multiple people named James.  But on the main points, there is widespread agreement.


##Jesus 

On to Jesus.  Of course, we have the Christian sources - the four Gospels, any of which would be considered primary source material.  Then we have the Roman historians, Tacitus and Josephus.  These aren't just random guys - Tacitus was a Governor, Senator, and even a Consul, and Josephus worked for Emperor Titus.

Both Tacitus and Josephus are in agreement on the main points - Jesus Christ taught and founded Christianity,  was condemned by Herod (Pontius Pilate), and crucified by the Romans.  Josephus also confirms the baptism of Jesus (by John the Baptist). Bottom line is that you can doubt some of the details, but you can't doubt that Jesus existed unless you deliberately apply an impossible high standard to him, specifically.

##Resurrection

Ok, fair enough, you're thinking, so Jesus was a real guy who was baptized, started a new religion, and was crucified.  But there's no evidence that he performed miracles, or was resurrected, right?  RIGHT?

Having multiple eyewitness accounts of a historical event that was witnessed by dozens or even hundreds of people is a historians dream, and that's exactly where we are on the resurrection.  According to the gospels, the tomb was empty, and Jesus made as many as five appearances to his family members, disciples, and even a crowd of people.  And according to Josephus, yes Jesus did rise from the dead, so that's third-party (non-Christian) confirmation.

If it wasn't the resurrection, nobody would doubt it's authenticity..  But what do you do with a historical record of something that you believe is impossible?  Only you can answer this question for yourself.  Personally though, I am glad to see that the world still holds a little mystery.

55,q5wyo4,There should be a mobile application that allows a man and a woman to sign abortion (physical and financial) BEFORE consummation of sexual act.,Noob_master_slayer,1633962218.0,3,0.57,12,"I would envision a mobile application where before the start of consensual sexual activity OR before the start of an agreed upon 'sexual' period (1 day to 1 year), the couple/FWB would virtually sign the same document on their respective phones and record a short video (30+ seconds across the room) to prove no compulsion was used. The video and the signed document then goes to a secure encrypted cloud server to prevent tampering.

If the woman became pregnant, and then if:

(a) The man wanted the child AGAINST the mother's wishes, she can have an abortion as usual, **no** questions asked.

(b) The woman wanted the child AGAINST the father's wishes, he can withdraw financial support (as stipulated in the virtual agreement) so the mother will support the child on her own OR she can abort.

(c) Both want the child, then normal pregnancy contiues to term.

I think this satisfies the entire issue because it gives both the man and the woman a CHOICE to opt out of parenthood, and it also gives a woman two choices in (b) so she can carry to term on her own choice (because SHE took the desicion) or she can abort.

We should halt all air travel permanently. Stop traveling by air. In fact, we should encourage human beings to not travel much at all. If they do they should travel by train or by car.

Nothing good comes from air travel. It was a nice novelty when it first picked up....a great way to go see another country...but **times have changed and visiting other countries is old ffashioned and  unsafe.** Time to move on.

Lastly, all the greenies and wokies should support this since A, it really only affects rich people, and B, it would eliminate the CO2 emissions from all these planes.

You might wonder how that is an unpopular opinion, but the amount of people who take part in Victim-blaming is just insane. The main offenders are misogynistic men and self-proclaimed nice guys towards women, but I've seen such behaviour such behaviour by women and men with no strong prejudices, and against both women and men.

Even if the victim had every single resource possible to avoid getting into an abusive/adulterous relationship, it would still not make their partner's actions right, nor it would reduce the harm done to them. And the arguments from victim-blamers are just ignorant, eg.

""She/He got together with an abuser/cheater instead of nice guy/girl (*like me* optional)""

Abusers and other human-sewage often have decent social lifes and a level of superficial charm, AKA **they are THE nice guys/girls**. If every abusive person had that tattoed on their forehead then we would be talking, but the world is not like that. Besides that, wake up to life, no one is going to get together with an unattractive, uninteresting, asocial loner only because they are 100% certified not an asshole (yet).

""She/He ignored the red flags""

Abuse is insidious and gradual, and cheating is discovered. Combine that with the uniqueness of each relationship, and **there are no red flags**.

I could go on, but I think made my thoughts clear.

now before y’all nail me to the cross let me just say i’ve always been and still am a huge dave chappelle fan. i begged my dad as a kid to get me the chappelle show box set for christmas and still rewatch it to this day. i still rewatch his older specials but the last 4 netflix specials have been nothing but cancel culture and gay/trans people. he constantly complains that he can’t make offensive jokes anymore and he’s being chastised for it, but still gets paid millions for any standup he does and let me be clear; you can still make “offense” jokes, but if your punchline relies solely on offending people then it’s not funny. punch down then up. i don’t understand why he is so concerned about cancel culture when he’s still regarded as the “GOAT”and to my knowledge, wasn’t ever even cancelled to begin with. for instance in his latest special he complained that people canceled Da Baby over his comments about gay people but not him shooting someone in walmart. Da Baby claimed self defense in the shooting, what he did on stage lambasting gay people was just unprovoked and vile. 

like with anything, as time passes, society evolves and society has evolved past the LGBTQ+ community being punchlines just like we’ve evolved past black and other POC being punchlines. his jokes just don’t really cater to the current climate of what’s funny anymore and he refuses to let shit go and come up with better material 

also spoiler; at the end he talks about his *one* trans friend but he exploits her story and suicide as his gotcha moment in attempt to show he isn’t transphobic while even calling himself a transphobe.

his old friend and co writer Neil Brennan on his podcast even says dave is a drama queen when it comes to stuff like this. 

to be honest; his comedy just seems repetitive and lazy now. like he’s the bully who is shocked when someone fights back. he said this last special would be his last and i really hope it isn’t but i hope ig and when he comes back his material won’t rely solely on gay people and cancel culture.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001771C7AF9E8>

89,q2or04,Capitalism isn't broken.,Connect-Zebra7173,1633539933.0,9,0.67,27,"Edit: posted here because r/unpopularopinion deleted it

I've seen a lot of comments around (here on Reddit) stating something to the effect of 'Capitalism is at fault for all the bad things'.

There is nothing wrong with Capitalism. It's not broken, it's not malicious, and it isn't at fault for your bad spending habits.

Capitalism at its core is based on the idea of economic freedom. Freedom is not a regulation nor a solution. It is the natural state of any economy before rules and regulations are applied. Capitalism allows room for prosperity for anyone, and poverty for anyone. It envelops both the good and the bad.

In my opinion, you all should be hating on Communism and Corporatism. Corporations strongly resemble Communist states in that they aggregate resources under singular, draconic control, and have very little or impersonal regard for their members and employees. Everything is done with the interest of the Company (under the pretense of everyone benefitting) in mind. That's a Communist state.

Under Capitalism, anything can happen. You could thrive, or you could fall. It's up to you and chance. It's not the fault of Capitalism if you let corporations buy all the land and houses, and then rent them out at an extortionate premium. If you don't like it, don't sell.

Capitalism allows for those things, but it also allows for you to legislate local (state level) laws on land ownership, as well as setting the value of the property low and using Eminent Domain to buy it all back for pennies on the dollar.

You can't blame economic tyranny on economic freedom.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001771C883470>
90,q2oh0i,You should be allowed to take up more than one seat on the train.,YoungQuahogMoney,1633539127.0,0,0.33,11," 

I was watching this video that was from a while back of a woman on a NJ Transit train who was sitting in one seat,  and her Louis Vuitton was parked in the seat next to her. 

People  were giving her a hard time because she wasn't allowing anyone to sit  next to her. She kept on saying ""I want my personal space, I don't want  you sitting next to me.""

Apparently this minor debacle was enough  to cause the conductor to stop the train so transit police can escort  her off the train.

I'm sorry, but this annoys me like hell. I've  seen posts on Muttr by someone who believes the same way she does and he  gets hell for it too. Sorry, but I have something to say:

1. When  it comes to open seats on trains, everyone keeps on trying to say ""if  you want to put your bag in a seat, pay for two seats"" or the  ever-infamous ""I paid for a ticket, I'm entitled to a seat.""

Sorry,  but the ""I paid for a ticket"" argument is stupid. EVERYONE paid for a  ticket. The only thing it entitles you to is to be transported from one  station to the next. That's it, no more no less.

2. There are  other seats available, always.  I suggest you try somewhere else instead  of DEMANDING that one person let you sit next to them. As rude as she  sounded, she's right. If she doesn't want someone sitting next to her,  she has every right to say no. She's entitled to her personal space, and  the fact that ""it's public transportation"" is not relevant. 

3.  Why did the person recording it even see it fit to record to begin with?  Doesn't she have anything better to do aside from shaming someone for  not thinking the way she thinks? This is America. People have choices,  and just because someone chooses to do something that isn't what you  want them to do doesn't mean you get to embarrass them for it.

**Louder for those in the back:**

***If you pay for a ticket, you are not entitled to a seat.***

***Paying for a ticket entitles you and your possessions on hand to be transported from one station to another.*** 

***Your ticket doesn't entitle you a seat, it doesn't even entitle you to get off at your intended destination station. It entitles you and your stuff to be transported. No more, no less.***",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001771C8D8358>

I personally think this is an controversial post, majority of Reddit, unless you are on r/Prolife, if you post a post that suggests you are pro-life you will be downvoted automatically, and they will usually pull out straw-men. 

Even though I am pro-life, clearly pro-choice people are free to share their opinions. I am not against that. It’s just that, instead I often hear straw-men and misinformation about the human embryo, I’ve heard claims that when the embryo is at 7-8 weeks of pregnant, (the weeks that majority of women have abortions), that the unborn child is only a cluster of cells. Which is definitely false, because majority of women don’t even know their pregnant when the embryo is an unicellular organism. 

https://www.ehd.org/dev_article_unit7.php

That we are only pro-birth and are only that way because we are sexist and want to punish women for their decision to have sex. 

Majority of women don’t even know their pregnant for half of the embryonic period, hence the outrage over the Texas Heartbeat Bill, which bans abortion after about 6 weeks of pregnancy, or so I’ve heard. There’s been a lot of misinformation about the bill, which is why I urge you, no matter what side you are on to read the bill yourself to know what the bill is against and what it isn’t. Which for those who are interested, is easily accessible online.

https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/SB00008H.pdf

It also seems that even the news shows bias against the pro-life position and favors the other sides view, even though they claim to be unbiased.

https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/nvp/articles/media/media.html

For basic summary, I’m frustrated by some of the discourse I see from people on the other side. I often hear claims that 7-8
weeks are only clusters of cells, that pro-life people are only that because they are religious, because they are sexist, even racist. Even when I was pro-choice, I found myself disagreeing with a good bit of what I found online, because I thought they weren’t  very good arguments from the pro-choice side, and were just straw-men. Not only that, but the blatant misinformation from both sides.

There just simply isn't any argument that servers should be tipped unless you demand all minimum wage workers get tips or ask minimum wage to be raised

Neutral media can't exist just because they must think about  what news should be covering and about what to talk. But this is only a little problem comparing to the fact that all our opinions is from our environment. Nearly all people that was raised during times of kings were monarchists (and even when they not it is only was because of some revolutionary leaders) , nearly all people that was raised during Soviet Union were communists, nearly all people that lived in Germany of 1932-1945 years were fascists.  Your opinions is not your opinions, it is product of your environment.

This though that I have has formed seeing how ignorant and uncultured are most of the elderly people in my country. They can't elaborate a personal way of thinking that isn't ""imposed"" by someone else.
For example:
Salvini is the leader of Lega, one of the top parties in Italy. _""Boomers""_ follows him just because their minds are too lazy to elaborate what he's actually saying.
10 years ago Salvini was supporting Padanian secession and he said that Italy is a shithole of a country, that southern Italians are fucking pigs and things like that. Nowadays he's a ultranationalist who loves southern Italy and that says that people from Africa are fucking pigs and stuff like that. Basically he's followed and he got lot of consent because he know what people want and he says what people want.

Salvini isn't the only party leader to do this. Also PD (Italian democratic party), M5S (populists), Fratelli d'Italia (ultra right wing) and Forza Italia (Right market liberals) are fucking shitty parties that decieve ignorant people to follow them just because they know what to tell to electors.

I saw lot of young people (18-30) that fucking hate this system. 7 out of 10 people that are under 30 don't vote anymore.
They're fucking tired of those parties that exist only because _""boomers""_ vote them.

We can't have a fucking good party that says the truth and that want what is truly good for Italy.

Nowadays Italian politics can be summarized in:

""Left""wing: Lmao those Right-wing fuckers are dumb as hell, they're fascists.

Rightwing: Lmao those Left-wing fuckers are so fucking stupid, they're commies.

Italy don't have a true Left-wing anymore, Even PD (top ""left""wing party) it's a fucking joke. They're considered _LeFt_ because they support LGBT rights. Nothing more. That's all.

We don't have a good Socialist/Communist party since the current ones always do things just to have 2-3 seats in the parliament. They care about the seats not the people.
We don't have a good liberal party since the current one is a fucking joke that cares only about free market and dont give a shit about civil rights.
We don't have a good rightwing conservative party since the current ones only cares to spread shit about immigrants and to exploit that sort of ""Boomer's-Nostalgia"" that most of over60 have.

Our political system is fucked up because parties only point to recieve votes from ignorant, dumb, lazyminds _""boomers""_ that can't understand what kind of shit they're voting.

In Italy, the elderly are the largest demographic category and the most ignorant. Less than 50% of them have a highschool degree and school before highschool only teaches you how to write, basic math and 0 to none literature.

I'm not surprised to see my country rolling down to the bottom of the abyss if we give to those dumbfucks that can't even speak properly the right to vote.

Vote it's not only a right, it's also a responsibility. You're fucking asked to decide the future of a country. Don't get surprised if populists are winning.

One of the ways I do this is by watching content creators on youtube from all across the political sphere. When I do this, I try to find the most reasonable who can put together the best arguments to represent different viewpoints.

There are a couple problems. For one, the overtun window keeps shifting further and further right. It's a key, and very effective, part of the fascist’s strategy. This means that more and more people, without their actual views changing at all, are being labelled left leaning when they were previously considered right leaning.

The second problem is the one alluded to in the title, and it's pretty closely related to the first. People keep being pushed out of right wing social groups for having opinions that even slightly differ from the group, or for incredibly petty stuff that either has nothing to do with politics or is informed by their right wing views. Stuff’s crazy.

For example, when righties accuse me of being left wing for watching people like Young Turks, I point out how I also watch people like Neo-Nazis and QAnon. Now don't get me wrong, all of these people believe a lot of crazy and incredibly stupid stuff, but they at least make fully formed arguments for their beliefs (less so with QAnon, but he's the best evangelical politics guy I've found so I can't ditch him).

However, Liz Cheney has been canceled for not falling for the Big Lie, and it's only a matter of time before Mitt Romney gets cancelled for being a pedo or some stuff. Now people are calling Liz forking Deep State and the only people these days who are considered right wing are the clinically insane people on YouTube like PragerU.

And that's kind of the point. By shunning anyone but the most extreme, they push the overtun window further and further which makes normies thing the extreme views are more normal, so they adopt them more.

I consider myself a centrist. I have very strong views on most major political topics, but they don't align with either the left or the right. Sometimes I agree with things that are strictly right wing ideas, and sometimes I agree with things that are strictly left wing. But having said that, the right really is toxic as hell. The left always seems to be the more understanding and reasonable side.

For instance if the government were coming to your house and arresting you because you posted something they didn't like that would be censorship but even then there's exceptions.  For example if you posted a threat of violence they could come over and investigate.  Or if you were running Ponzi scams.

Now, Reddit being a private corporation, they legally own both the servers and the code that runs reddit.  When you sign up to use Reddit as a service, you are entering into a legally binding contract by which you agree to abide by the Terms of Service in exchange for use of the the servers and the code.  Just as you're free to stop posting at any time, or free to delete your account at any time, Reddit as a private corporation has the right to decide what goes up on there server's and can also terminate a relationship at any time by deleting your account or banning you.

Forcing people to put things up that they don't want is something that is done by petty little socialist/communist dictators.  Similar to how in North Korea every family has to have a picture of Kim Jong Un in they're house whether they want one or not.

For example, the belief that if a woman says “no” to a date with a man, he should believe her the first time, and not try to change her mind.

As a lesbian, you will always reject a man’s offer of a date or sex, right?

So why can’t you accept that hetero women have the right to reject you because you are a woman? 

It is a sexual boundary, no less legitimate than yours.

Telling a woman that she SHOULD date women, when you know she doesn’t want to, is powerfully anti-consent. 

Would you want to be in a sexual relationship with someone who you know is not attracted to you, and moreover, who you know is attracted only to men? Surely not - so why inflict that experience on other lesbians? Do you think they deserve to be used in this way?

Being a hetero woman and choosing abstinence is one thing, but it’s not feminist to tell women that they have to live in a way that’s actively inauthentic. In the same way that lesbians don’t need to be “fixed” by men, hetero women do not need fixing, and their sexual orientation will not change no matter how much unwanted sex they engage in (also known as rape).

Penny White made a YouTube video discussing her experience with this. She said that “lesbians don’t want you to try [to become lesbian].” I hope this is true of most of them. So many on the internet insist that you can’t be a real feminist if you don’t date or have sex with women, and it’s a harmful lie. Don’t shame women for being hetero. Don’t pressure them into sex that they don’t want. Don’t pretend that rape is inevitable if you date men, and therefore all women raped by their boyfriends/husbands deserved it. Don’t pretend that all men rape. Don’t pretend that women are not violent psychopaths who can always be trusted not to rape. Sixty percent of women in same-sex relationships report being abused by their partner, compared to thirty-five percent of women who date men, so why lie? You never know whether the woman you’re trying to brainwash is a survivor of same-sex rape, like me.

195,ptxhp9,r/HermanCainAward DOES NOT violate the Reddit ToS,,1632410346.0,23,0.68,57,"This will be the most controversial post and view Reddit will have. But to be honest, throughout my research and gathering of this process... I am willing to accept every outcome headed my way.

After looking around at r/HermanCainAward, especially with it's growth (whether by the recent articles or not), as a fond person of researching I decided to tackle the claims the people make that say that sub is bad because it celebrates death. This is accompanied by them stating that it breaks the rules of Reddit. Mainly Rule 1. So in order to tackle these claims, I present to you this post.

First let's go over, **Rule 1**

>Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. ***Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.***

[Inciting violence](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151) and [the hate sections](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951) have hyperlinks in them so they can provide examples in terms of context.

This is what people who dislike the sub form their basis on breaking ToS. This rule thanks to it's last section on both grounds. So now let's dissect them one by one.

First, **inciting violence**. To incite by definition [thanks to webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incite#:~:text=transitive%20verb,up%20%3A%20spur%20on%20%3A%20urge%20on), it is to encourage, urge, or stir up. Is the sub encouraging Anti-Vaxxers to die? No, absolutely not. The majority of the posts are post screen caps which critique anti-vaxxers and showcase how COVID disinformation kills. The posts with the caps are catalogued in chronological order, starting from people believing in disinformation about COVID to either their demise or their realization. How is basing something off of a poster showcasing another persons history ""inciting violence""?

This is the easiest to debunk. How easy? Is the OP of the post voicing their opinion of them? No. It's just their history. The fact they have no thoughts about the person and that they are showcasing the person's life is not encouraging violence. If that's the case, most history subs would be banned

If you still don't believe me, go into any of the posts and look at the criteria I posed. As in look back at that same webster definition and see if it applies to comments.

Plus consider the second rule of that sub, which is ""don't root for nominees to be awarded"". If that comment is inciting, the mods will report it and take it down because that's wishing death, promoting it, which is against Reddit's rules. They know that comments that promote death can get banned, plus [considering the nature that this sub doesn't want to exist but because of them are anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/HermanCainAward/comments/psyp4w/for_those_who_say_the_hca_are_immoral_lets_see/), it's right for them to do to enforce that rule.

Next, **hate based on identity**. How Reddit identifies hate by identity falls under these categories and I quote;

>based on their actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability. These include victims of a major violent event and their families. 

This other bad faith argumentation of the sub is on the grounds of their own political identity, because apparently it is now a political side. This is tricky to dissect. While one could argue political identity being a part of the many examples of hate on identity, I argue against that.

If we want to go further into this let's look at the possible counter-argument, [did you know that companies can deny you because of your political beliefs?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2021/02/24/is-political-discrimination-in-the-workplace-legal/?sh=7778d88c68dd) [This extends more to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964) This would be a no-shit moment if you've been banned in political subs where your ideals are different from the majority but this is reality. That is not the case with here.

Why not? If I am honest, while I can make a case that a company denying a person thanks to their political views is discrimination, in a case like this subreddit and other related areas to it, it's very different.

One is a job that require humans to work for to ensure their livelihood, the other is just a club with no purpose. One is about working for change for your right to paycheck, the other is goofing off. You see? One is client to client for their needs, the other is just not about the needs and is only one-party.

That sub is that other. It's not providing needs to other people out of necessity. Jobs vs subs are very different.

Also for the main meat to connect this; political identity's change over time as we grow and develop new takes on situations, one idea today could be a bad one later. Political affiliations swing from human to human as we get older or we get exposed to new identity's. To put it bluntly, the things Reddit listed such as race, identity, gender, sex, disability are all things we can't change. Political affiliation we can change. So why discriminate when we can change affiliations?

The virus has no political sides, this virus took the left and the right, even some anti-vaxxers are left wings too but very very rarely is that the case. Even if the majority is the opposition, it's not hate because you can change it. If you can't change it and that's your personality/life/body, it's hate. That's in layman's terms Reddit provided.

TL;DR: That sub **does not** violate Reddit ToS. The incitement is not there, and the hatred is non-existent. That sub is all a PSA about how disinformation in today's society can kill by showcasing a person's life. Call it a memorial, call it a scared straight message, but it isn't a place to dance at deaths.

Also I find it ironic that for people on Reddit who hate this sub (mainly some on the opposition) are also Free Speech Warriors. It's funny really, you claim to support Free Speech but be willing to ban this sub... That's funny.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001771FCDCB38>

198,pttlsp,People complain about vegans because they feel insecure in their own diet choices,Caelus9,1632398304.0,16,0.57,630,"I think vegans get a lot of hate. Sometimes, it's for some crazy shit PETA is doing, but for the vast majority of times, it's clear people just enjoy getting annoyed or angry at vegans easier. It's never made sense to me. Veganism isn't a choice that effects other people. If anything, given veganism has less of an environmental impact, it's considerably better for those around you to be vegan.

Yet, the anger persists. Why? Well, it's pretty simple. People feel insecure, because they're aware that meat-eating is the ethically worse option. Meat-eating is unhealthier, it hurts the environment and it leads to all that disgusting, sadistic shit that we put animals through. And, let's be honest... at this point, we're all aware of that fact. The evidence is so overwhelming that anyone who denies veganism is better is just doing some premium coping, and it's honestly so pathetic.

If you want to eat meat, feel free. People make bad choices all the time, that's human nature. I don't particularly care either way. It's the weakness I see in a lot of meat-eaters that annoys me. The inability to just be strong and stand by the choices you make, rather than having to lie and pretend you're not picking the worse option. It's like a smoker trying to still argue ""Smoking actually helps, look at this study from the 1860s!"" Honestly, it's embarrassing.

Oh, and not that it's relevant to the opinion, but I'm not a vegan. Meat is absolutely delicious, especially in a nice BBQ. I'm about to eat some pulled pork in a sandwich right now. I recognize veganism as the better option, but so is not smoking when I drink, and I don't do that either.

Since 1920 and the League of Nations this idea has been thrown around. Today we have the United Nations, and although today it doesn’t really do much besides some aid work, the foundation for a one world government is already here.


If you think that it’s impossible because the world is too divided, look at the European Union. 80 years ago Europe was still a war zone, with all the little countries fighting for dominance. Today, all of Western Europe essentially functions as one nation, to great benefit of its members. Yeah, the UK left, and it’s been a disaster. England trying to play empire again like it’s 1912. The UK will have no choice but to go back to the EU soon.

The only thing needed for transition to a one world government is a world changing crisis. Something much bigger than covid. Either another world war or climate change. But I doubt any major nations will go to war because of nuclear weapons, but climate change is inevitable and already happening.

Racism is seen as wrong and immoral... but discrimination based on nationality is common place. Almost everyone seems to agree it's fine.

Pretty simply, the reason racism is bad is because you're discriminating against someone for a characteristic of their birth that they did not choose and that has no effect on their character. Another characteristic that fits that exact same field? Nationality.

People would have an outcry if a patient was denied service because he was white or black, but the notion that illegal immigrants not only don't deserve healthcare, but should have their kids taken away and be kicked out of the country is commonplace. There's a debate over how inhumane the discrimination should be, but near everyone agrees it's justified.

I see people get offended by this opinion, and it's certainly very unpopular. But honestly? Not once have I ever seen an actual argument, let alone a rational one, for this discrimination.

It's scientifically called ""[active immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/immunity-types.htm)"" and the science community has agreed since the beginning of time that it offers almost life-long protection.

None of these mandates/vaccine passports make sense with what we know about this virus and the vaccines. People who are pro-vaccine mandate are spreading literal misinformation from Jan 2021 to further defend the mandates when all of that has changed.

I believe the exact opposite. The strong, smart, brave, and competent have a duty to help those less fortunate than themselves. Putting them under pressure rarely works as a way to help such people stand on their own feet, notwithstanding inspirational motivation stories. In fact, it's more likely to make them less effectual, due to raising the price for so-called self-improvement (I say so-called because my idea of self-improvement is moral and ethical, of which money, power, sex appeal, popularity, glory-getting, community status and prestige is no substitute). With that said, I'll go on to my reasons I don't take either those phrases seriously, and even say that victim-blaming is immoral in and of itself.

&#x200B;

\-  Confuses *inability* to stop or reverse a bad thing with *willfully allowing* a bad thing happen (""letting"", a usual synonym for allowing, is also victim-blaming)

\- Fails to see that sometimes lack of bad intent *does* excuse undesirable outcomes, even if other times it's no ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" card.

\- Shifts responsibility on people least able to handle the difficulty,  thereby putting an unreasonable burden on the person (How can you be responsible for something if you're unable to deal with it?)

\- Sees responsibility itself more in terms of *favorable results*, rather than taking an unsuccessful action against the bad thing.

\- Ignores the unique details of the person's life experience that caused him or her to take either no or insufficient action to stop the bad thing, This includes repeated experiences of even worse treatment or scorn for actually trying and failing than if they didn't try at all (which, let's face it, is not exactly a rare reaction from onlookers).

\-Shoehorns the average person's abilities and talents into the victim, thus making a false comparison.

\- Irrationally shames victimhood itself when the victim clearly lacked intent to do a bad thing to anyone. This implies the blamer has either crude understandings of free will or vastly underestimates either (a) the bad consequences of a failed effort to stop a bad thing

And these are why I find ""Toughen Up!"", ""Don't be stupid!"" as supposed motivators or otherwise ""cures"" for another person's shortcommings a joke.  Only detailed sympathetic back and forth conversations can even begin to alleviate any supposed problem. Unfortunately, that also means that the mainstream also has to open its mind to the prospect that they are the ones mistaken and/or the victim is justified in their victimhood.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001772031DBA8>

I have always wondered what socialism would be like today if the more democratic forces within the revolution actual won over Lenin's faction.

There was a genuine chance we could have seen a much more benign and humane socialism, one where there could have been a better alternative to the capitalist systems we have today.

They still allowed private property, not to the degree of mega corporations but they did genuinely have more respect for human rights.

Yet people on both sides associate socialism with Marx and Lenin, and I personally think there is something tragic about this.

I've been online for a long time to really understand this fully than most who're too prideful that they go around, boastfully declaring how they've deleted their Facebook, their Instagram, their Twitter .etc

And the fact of the matter is - no one really cares. You're fluffing your ego and self-esteem a little, while also being the beacon as to how you're part of the problem I'm talking about.

You see, Mark Zuckerberg may have had a point in that recounted quote people love to display whenever the topic of him or FB comes up. The quote where he calls people dumbasses for trusting him. I think that rings true for a lot of the behavior that people do online. They invest so much trust and hand off responsibility to all of the online services to handle things *for them*. It's honestly like being that dumb mother who popped 3 kids and wants people to watch them overnight so she can go out and get wasted. It's exactly like that.

And still, over the years, people have demonstrated that it's their bad faith and bad intent online is what's been making the atmosphere of social media toxic. But why blame yourself, when it's easier to just brand yet another thing as toxic?

I'll never argue with anyone about social media being bloated, because it seriously is. But I'll die on the hill that social media isn't that toxic as people say. Social Media is an engine and it needed a fuel tank to run.

Masculinity is another example. What used to be seen as normal male behavior now gets labelled as toxic, mostly by women. Not only do a lot of males enjoy that behavior, the idea that women get a say in what’s considered acceptable masculinity is insane.

So this is a good alternative.

You know how in the US where we live it's two parties? I say fuck this American Tribalism Bullshit. No one is thinking straight in the world of politics. Hell, no one debates anymore in a way that drives discussion. People have been putting your own party in front instead of putting your country front. And for what purpose? To own someone, to own the libs or conservatives in this world? When they tried to do something that they care about, they have done nothing, did jackshit, and when they do it, it’s just to get validation and not REAL change.

I have been living here for my entire GODDAMN life, I have multiple people who have a lot of political ideas with many solutions but are forced into an us-vs-them thanks to the “left” and “right” mentality that killed what I believe is essential to Democracy, CIVIL fucking DISCOURSE. We all have many ideas with many solutions but because of them, we get shit talked and one side has one solution that we have to agree on not realizing there are multiple ideas out there. I understand the two-party system and to be honest, both sides have policies that differ in certain aspects.

And my whole thesis is basically because we are so individualized in every way, we have a lot of ideas at our disposal, but with two sides, we don't utilize every idea, if both ideas from both sides are trash, why can't we make another one? It's the same us-them mentality that drives it, eliminating independent thought and ideas.

There are no sides. And judging from the state of human rights in America, the real enemies are the ones taking any humans rights away regardless of gender, sex, race, ethnic, etc. There are claims that human rights are being stripped thanks to Republican Party. They are not one sided, I’ve seen both sides limit and take away human rights on both ends of the spectrum. And before you piss your pants and say this is centrist talk, yeah fucking right, “centrism” is a dumb buzzword to eliminate the idea of independent political thinkers who have solutions that are wildly different from both sides.

Also the amount of hypocrisy, GOOD GOD, it’s even MORE proof we run on party over country. Most of these ""sides"" only care about these issues if it benefits their party, cases in point:

Those free speech warriors; Like banning TikTok over no proof and all misinformation all because its user base criticized the right and those warriors tried to slander the company then promote GETTR who actively censors the left ([including this group who debunks the TikTok misinfomation](https://gettr.com/post/p2evef)).

Those Blue Lives Matter who stormed the capitol gunning down the police that they themselves “love so much”. Holy fuck, even the police killed one and these people made that person the hero while pissing over George Floyd to shill police love when they also shill the “hero” who got gunned down by police. I think her name was... Ashli Babbitt?

And these two are just the beginning!

Hell I don’t think they gave a shit about China or Russia or now with Afghanistan and the Taliban, they just use it as a buzzword for validation but do NOTHING to solve the issue. For instance: As much as everyone on Reddit “hates” China, THE SIDES HAVEN’T DONE SHIT. Why don’t they just make a change by protesting over there and promote country over party by realizing that party’s do jack and making the US known there?

Yep I said it, those are keyboard warriors. I guess all these party’s can do is comment China and Russia Bad and be all talk and no bite. Pussies is the better term.

Yes. Them bad. But are they doing something about it besides posting a comment on reddit for feeling validation? No. Posting it to promote your party by being a slacktivist? Yes. The sides care about their issues if it benefits them, and not everyone. They care about themselves. That's what these sides do! It's a ploy to destroy civil discourse and democracy!

Yes, it is all that it is, performative slacktivism! They NEVER gave a FUCK about any issue, they just promote it and IGNORE it to promote your PARTY. Hell even then, these guys will spew misinformation no matter the side to promote your ideology.

They care about CLOUT and CLOUT alone to fuel the division instead of CHANGE.

Speaking of which...

I understand we have a lot of questions about the law, but FUCK we have a lot of case laws set in place that they ignore under the guise of “fake news” and “propaganda”. Critical thinking and research is dead, these ""sides"" want to be reinforced. And that’s the worst part, each sides ideology has multiple influences for both parties and you have to pick the side who has the most ideologies that you want to see change. It’s lesser of the two evils and it promotes THIS. This toxic team battle that ends up killing rational, civil, and respectful discussion that you fuckers, no matter the side, think it’s for the fucking “greater good”.

This affirmed a June Cleveland Clinic study of health-care workers (who are often exposed to the virus), in which none who had previously tested positive for the coronavirus got reinfected. The study authors concluded that “individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from covid-19 vaccination.” And in May, a Washington University study found that even a mild covid infection resulted in long-lasting immunity.

Obesity is a serious problem in the First World, and it's something we're going to need to deal with. I'm not saying that we should treat obesity as a positive, nor should we encourage it. 

However, we need to teach fat people to love themselves, and their bodies, so that they can improve upon them. After all, one can love something while acknowledging it has faults, and if anything, loving something is going to make you much more likely to dedicate the effort to fix those faults.

We can see that with how damaging the inverse, fat shaming, is. It's been proven time after time to be ineffective, because shame makes people eat.

Anyone who suggests this as a solution is either just really stupid, or doesn't care about actually helping and just wants to try make themselves feel better for their own weaknesses.

The solution isn't to make fat people hate their bodies. We need to teach fat people to love their bodies. Not to think their bodies are perfect, mind you, but to see that their bodies are something worthy of love and something that should be improved upon. People need to be pushed towards change in a positive way that doesn't just make them feel like crap and eat more.

This is far from the only problem, of course. There's a lot of other factors in play here, like how fatty foods are often cheaper, how corporations can obscure what is and isn't healthy and, of course, people just being stupid and not taking into account how they're destroying their bodies.

We’ve all done shit were not proud of at a time in our lives when we didn’t know any better or thought we were justified. You should be anxious, it’s a good indicator that you may need to take a look at your own actions. 

What does it say about men’s behaviour when most women have been sexually harassed or assaulted at some point in their lives? It means there are men out there engaging in that activity, so the anxiety and worry makes sense.

So all this “falsely accused” talk is just the runaround, an avoidance at talking about the real issues which is consent. 

Does this mean no man is innocent? Of course not, there are men out there who have never commit any crime. 

Does this mean there’s never been a woman to accuse someone of something they didn’t do? Nope, crazy ass awful people exist in the world.

For example, ""Sorry To Bother You"" was very woke but it was also a great movie. The Aladdin(2019) movie does fit the definition of woke due to it removing the racism from the original movie and tripling down on the feminist themes of the original but it does this so well that a lot of anti-woke people didn't even perceive it as woke and it actually had a pretty fun script and amazing visuals. I also thought that Antebellum(2020) was pretty solid. It had its boring moments but it was good overall.

Also, Avatar: The Last Airbender(the TV show)is proof that if your talented enough, you can make anti woke people love something woke.

This proposal would still make sure that they still have something to lose, while still giving them actual options that don't involve ruining their life

>There would be an epidemic of single mothers

This proposal would limit this because 1) they would have an incentive to take precautions as explained in the previous point, and 2) if someone is irresponsible, this would limit the number of pregnancies they could cause

>Financial abortions are unfair because signing a paper isn't comparable to a medical procedure

Under this, a medical procedure IS required for men as well

>Financial abortions allow them to abandon a child and then have a second one later. This is extremely unfair to the first child

This concern would not apply in the majority of cases, because they would basically be opting out of fatherhood entirely, unless they happen to already have kids or they choose to adopt
