0,sp67vu,This subreddit has become a place where Trump supporters can share their bigoted opinions,Total_Abrocoma2197,1644498419.0,0,0.41,47,"This is maybe more of a meta-post, but also an unpopular opinion. In the past few weeks, 75 percent of the unpopular opinions here are salty Trump supporters or Trump leaning individuals who have no where else to post with the_donald and other related subreddits shut down. So naturally they're turning to one of the only subreddits where it's okay to post pro-Trump or Trump leaning stuff. I am always constantly finding myself reporting posts.Not saying it's inaccurate to post that here, because these opinions are indeed unpopular. But we should be careful, or this subreddit will quickly dwindle into alt-right conspiracy theories (which I feel like it's becoming if the last few weeks are any indication)

2,sp3lk3,"if anti-vegans want to attract more people to their movement, they need to stop forcing their ideology on everyone they meet and stop hypocritically accusing vegans of doing that.",Lovethecreeper,1644489080.0,0,0.46,85,"I want to make it clear that I am not a vegan, nor does that make me (or you) anti-vegan. You can be not a vegan without being anti-vegan because anti-veganism is an ideology that you have to subscribe to. I am not speaking from the point of view of someone subscribed to those ideologies, but rather someone observing it from the sidelines.

A big point of anti-veganism is how vegans are extremists trying to force their ideology on other people. While there are a small subset of vegans who do that, it is very hypocritical for anti-vegans to say that because they are doing the exact same thing but even worse. The difference between anti-vegans and vegans in this case is that I've met vegans that act like normal people, but I've never spoken to an anti-vegan who wasn't keen to shove their ideology down my throat any chance they got to. 

There are some bad apples when it comes to veganism for sure, but I am convinced that there is not a single anti-vegan who isn't also an extremist. The anti-vegan community is just as bad if not worse then the more extreme vegans. The least extreme anti-vegans I've talked to are similar to an annoying vegan except advocating for the opposite ideology. The most extreme anti-vegans are even worse then the most extreme vegans. While I think that people like ""That Vegan Teacher"" are absolutely crazy, there is a sizable amount of anti-vegans that are somehow even worse and less approachable then she is. 

The worst anti-vegans I interacted with on a personal level are the absolute moral authoritarians that govern the r/cringetopia subreddit, who banned me for posting anti-vegan cringe. I tried messaging them, but no response.

For the anti-vegans out there reading this, I get it, you consume animal products and want to continue consuming animal products. Stop shoving it in all our faces.

13,sns2uy,"Scientology (and any UFO cult) is more plausible than Christianity, Islam, and Every Other Major Religion",Beeker93,1644347271.0,2,0.55,10,"I am not religious. I know lots of perfectly reasonable religious people. Majority don't believe or interpret the stories and mythology as factual and think humans wrote them. The ones that do tend to have cognitive dissonance and we just don't talk about it. Many just find it to be a framework for how to live life, to be used along side current cultural norms and laws. And I enjoy many parts to religion, weather it is philosophy, art, charity, history, and architecture. Ultimately I think live and let live, provided they aren't hurting anyone. This goes for other forms of belief aside from religion too (like extreme nationalism and other forms of tribalism). I hope there is something after death as it would just be more desirable, I just don't think it is logical and am content with what ever happens.  


With that out of the way. There is most likely aliens out there somewhere in our universe. We don't have the largest sample to go by for planets, but it would still seem like it would be statistically impossible for there not to be. We can find important precursors to life in random places and on meteors too (Adenine for example, a nucleotide base in DNA, RNA, and part of ATP). The universe is unfathomably vast, with trillions and trillions of stars, and based on experiments on Earth that mimic early Earth conditions (Miller-Urey experiment), the formations of these precursor to life molecules seem to be inevitable. There are bound to be places out there that mimic conditions here. But with all the extremophile organisms here, life could also thrive in extreme conditions out there.  


Scientologists believe an alien dude brought members from his overpopulated planet here and killed them in volcanoes, brainwashed their souls, for their souls to travel around and bind to the primitive people back them. Aliens are most likely out there somewhere, but all the major religions require there to be souls/ghosts anyways, so that is one outlandish thing Scientology has in common.  


God is unlikely (not impossible). If we use Occam's razor, either:  
1- The universe has always existed in some form, weather a singularity or earlier universe before the big bang (simplest explanation).  
2- The universe was created out of nothing during the big bang (requires an extra step, less simple).  
3- Some all knowing, all powerful creature/creatures has existed in some form always, and they decided to make the universe out of nothing (requires the most extra steps, therefore is less simple).  


If we look at instincts such as the desire to survive, we can deduce why every culture wants and believes there is an afterlife. Other instincts like forming hierarchical structures, we can see why some being would be placed on top. And if we just think about how a human with these instincts would try to interpret the world around them (why we exist etc) we can see why belief systems such as creationism, monotheism, pantheism, and animism came about. So the fact that every culture believes in some of the same things is nothing special.  


If we look at people's stories about dyeing on the operating table, we see differences based on cultural beliefs, inconsistencies where people who are good but think they are bad go to hell, but bad people who think they are good go to heaven (in the most objective form of good and bad cross culture, like serial murderers and child rapists). We also run into the issue where people aren't declared dead with the same criteria everywhere. In the past and in developing nations, it was when your heart stopped. In other parts its when parts of your brain shut down, in much of the developed world, it's once you are brain dead (though you can be a living braindead husk attacked to machinery). In the end it is pretty much when you pass the point where we can revive you. We also have the issue of trusting a failing and dyeing brain. If those experiences count as evidence, why not a schizophrenics delusions or a psychedelic experience? But I digress.

I know religion bashings is popular on Reddit, but it seems far more acceptable to rip on Scientologists or UFO cults in every day life than to make fun of any major religion.  


TLDR: Scientology and UFO cults are more plausible than every other major religion because statistically it is likely there are aliens out there in the vast expanse of space. Both require the existence of souls so they are even there. But a giant, all knowing and all powerful being(s) that exists outside of space and time, creating the universe out of nothing seems highly unlikely if not impossible. As for everything else in religious books, it just serves as further evidence against the accuracy of those religions if you take it for face value and literally.

16,snjfp2,I think the criticism of the police as a whole remains mostly unwarranted. And here’s why.,mattcojo,1644324591.0,19,0.7,21,"Recently I saw a comment by another user on this sub that was quite critical of the US police force as a whole. Which is fine. Criticism can lead to understanding. I however didn’t agree with the kind of criticism of police in this circumstance. 

(Index in the comments).

1. A criticism I saw in one of the comments was that “cops don’t do a good job and they’re not worth the money they’re paid”. Here’s what was said in the comment.

> But, statistically, cops don't do a pretty good job. They're actually really, really bad at their jobs, even if you ignore all the corruption and abuse and oppression, solving around 2% of major crimes.

I have several questions for this statistic (a link to an article was posted in the comment).

What counts as a “major crime” then? The article never says.

How many of these “crimes” end up as false alarms that have to be reported?

How many of these crimes are actually reported?

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/03/01/most-violent-and-property-crimes-in-the-u-s-go-unsolved/

Statistics show that the biggest factor in cases being unsolved are the fact they’re not even reported in the first place. Even in the wildly unspecific 2% of cases article, the author conceded that 50% of “serious” crimes don’t even get reported. 

With the stats in the source I provided shows fairly reasonable, in my opinion, percent of cases solved for major crimes. 

Petty theft naturally is a hard crime to prove. Same with rape or automobile incidents. That’s not blamable on police.

Murder on the other hand has a fairly decent success rate in being concluded, and thanks to technology in criminal Justice this number is rising. I’d like to compare this with other countries. 

2. Then I see this argument. 

> So, they don't do good jobs, we know that. What about their other duties? Well... those include forcing families into the street because they're too poor and can't afford to pay to stay in their homes, and harassing and imprisoning people for victimless crimes, like smoking a joint, or... the 30,000 children under the age of 10 who've been arrested the past decade.

I don’t see how that’s a policing problem. If there’s any argument here it’s that they’re merely the reapers while the people in charge of making the laws (y’know, the ones that say “imprison the people for smoking a joint”) are the devils. 

3. Then there’s the argument of corruption. 

According to Google there’s 17,985 US police agencies at all levels of governing: local, county, state, and federal. You cannot fairly identify “all cops as bastards” when there’s so many separate agencies that really don’t have much to do with each other in my opinion. 

4. Then there’s the alleged racism.

I really don’t like that argument much either. Again going back to numbers, there’s over 700,000 policemen (that essentially mirror the demographics of the US) in over 17,000 departments. I don’t see how we can fairly define one or even a few cops.

5. And lastly was the argument of abuse: the 40% of cops studies (they allege that 40% of cops are abusive spouses). This one is the best argument I saw but I don’t agree that it’s a great argument.

The “40%” cops studies were both done in the early 1990’s by an organization that was intentionally critical of policing.

I’m not going to try to disprove the statistics or anything, but the studies do deserve a second look.

This doesn’t even indicate any real problem that policing itself causes. Rather that policing has certain kinds of people, in particular men, that join the force and these men usually are a lot more physically aggressive than men in other professions.

It also says that basically all the research done before it shows that teacher pay has no real effect on student outcomes aside from correlations like rich kids in rich districts would have relatively higher-paid teachers but that wouldn't really be the cause for any of the above. Richer kids would just have richer parents who were more ""socioeconomically"" successful.

So pretty much even if you increase pay by 10% *across the board* that would theoretically only move the needle enough to save about a smallish percentage of the current dropouts (3-4% of the dropout *rate)*.

I’ve had points in my life where I lean much more right and I’ve come to realize that at that time I was very angry and resentful towards all types of people and the media on the right was confirming my biases. After some MAJOR self searching I realized that my views are more in line with the left and that my right wing beliefs were all rooted in emotion/anger/fear. I wish I was better at expressing my ideas around this. I also want to clarify that there are many obnoxious leftists that make us all look bad BUT the right uses these extreme cases for wholesale condemnation of all leftists. To be more specific about the specific issues I think we can definitely achieve universal free health care, a better social safety net, re allocate some funding towards teachers, raise the minimum wage, etc. I don’t agree with all leftist issues btw. Just mostly I lean left. I know this is probably gonna get downvoted to hell because I used to be one of the people that would downvote this instantly because it is not in line with the right. The right wing sells resentment and fear. I believe it used to be a respectable party but something has changed. It’s addictive to be sold resentment, fear and bias confirmation. If I can leave you with one last thing I would day try to deep dive into your biases. Think about your thinking. Why do I think what I think and how much is rooted in unjustified resentment?

Even if it had political commentary, I can still enjoy S1-10 South Park as just a vulgar comedy about a bunch of bratty foul-mouthed kids. S10-15 was still good though it had comparatively more sucky episodes like a Million Little Fibres and HumancentIpad. Also I feel like that Chef character's death kind of took away a part of the show's soul. After season 15, except for stuff like the black friday trilogy and cock magic, the show felt kind of bland for the most part. S18 onwards the show felt almost entirely like a political cartoon and the political allegories felt like some ""flavor of the week"" stuff that already feels dated just a week after it comes out.

42,sj6ppr,marvel studios is making the absolute right call by not recasting t`challa,herequeerandgreat,1643853428.0,3,0.62,23," in august of 2020, we lost one of the most promising stars of our time. the late and the great chadwick boseman. chadwick was an amazing actor and, in my opinion, gave one of the best acting performances of the MCU. when i saw captain american civil war and black panther, i didn\`t see an actor playing black panther. i saw black panther. boseman was an amazing actor who\`s career was tragically cut short. he will forever be remembered and will be sorely missed.

now, onto the issue at hand.

following boseman\`s death, marvel studios announced that they would not be recasting the role of t\`challa out of respect for boseman. this was a choice that most marvel fans, including myself, agreed with. some marvel fans have even suggested that t\`challa\`s sister shuri take on the mantle of black panther like she did in the comics. however, in the last couple of months, marvel fans have done a complete 180. they now wanted marvel studios to recast t\`challa and are even throwing out names like will smith and john david washington.

ignoring for the moment that it\`s damn near impossible for another actor to even come close to how amazing boseman was, this whole thing is absolutely baffling. what happened to preserving boseman\`s legacy? chadwick boseman didn\`t play black panter. he BECAME black panther. plus, it\`s just disrespectful to his legacy. that would be like if christopher nolan recast the joker for the dark knight rises.

thankfully, marvel studios and ryan koogler seem to be ignoring these people and are going ahead with whatever their current plans are. for that, they get a big round of applause from me. although i\`m usually all for studios listening to the fans, i do think that there are some times where listening to the fans is actually a bad idea. and this is one such case.

45,sir6l8,Non-consensual non-medical circumcision of anyone is a women's right's issue.,Itrusttheinternett,1643815182.0,0,0.34,122," 

In America, up to 76% of the male population is circumcised, around the world, many people have their bodily autonomy violated for non-medically necessary reasons.

If one of the first experiences people have when they are brought into the world is extreme pain and their bodily autonomy not being respected it is going to negatively affect their neurological development, and their perception of the rights of themselves and others. At any point in life, non-medical violations of a person's bodily autonomy is going to negatively affect their development.

Non-medical forced cutting of children will contribute to the creation of bad people in society who go on to hurt others.

It will lead to the creation of more people who do not respect boundaries of others, and do not respect consent.

Specifically in regards to men, circumcising a man's foreskin removes the rolling function of the foreskin and therefore turns the penis into a battering ram, creating increased friction and resulting in more abrasions for himself and his partner. It also results in less lubricant being retained inside their partner and therefore causes less pleasurable and more painful sex. Because the penis is less sensitive the man needs to use greater force when engaging in sexual activities and this will result in less empathetic, fulfilling, and engaging sex

[r/intactivism](https://www.reddit.com/r/intactivism/) is a place for everyone. Women, men, non-binary, LGBT+. Making bodily autonomy a human right will benefit everyone.

Making bodily autonomy a human right will also ensure the rights of intersex people and women from non-consensual non-medical forced genital cutting. These issues are important and need to be addressed.

At [r/Intactivism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Intactivism/) we are mostly made up of men who have been hurt by the practice of forced non-medical genital cutting during childhood. Our worthy movement would only be aided by the greater addition of diverse voices and perspectives.

59,sgjv9p,Abandoning a kid if you find out you're not their biological parent is a shitty thing to do.,Namebunchanumbers,1643579167.0,2,0.54,32,"- Note that I am *not* talking about abandoning the *family*. Obviously you shouldn't be glossing over that kind of betrayal, and never seeing or speaking to the ex who did that to you is better than they deserve.

You've seen the scenario on circlejerk threads a million times: you have a kid who you've been raising for a significant portion of their life - long enough that they consider you a parent - under the belief that you are, in fact, their biological parent. One day, you find out the worst case scenario: you're not actually related to them! 

- Are you a bad person for throwing a drink in your spouse or partner's face and telling them to never speak to you again unless it's through your lawyer? Absolutely not.

- Are you a bad person for feeling weird about and mentally questioning your relationship with your child in light of this new information, needing therapy and even a break from them to process? Absolutely not.

- Are you a bad person for deciding to **never see the child who you until recently believed to be your biological son or daughter again**? *In my opinion*, yes.

Why is this? Well, when you have a kid, a good parent loves them unconditionally. If you decide you're no longer a parent if you're not biologically related, whoops, that's a condition. 

*In my opinion*, if your parental love ends the minute you find out something like this, you don't love the *child*, you love the *idea* of *having* a child. 

If you loved them, you wouldn't be able to stand the idea of never being able to see them again. Your first reaction would be to make sure you can secure custody, not to peace out and tell the kid to have a nice life. 

The kid is a 100% innocent party in this. They've done nothing wrong, and their love for you is unchanged. If they still love you as their parent, why can't you love them as your child? 

- Of course, Reddit loves to lean on transactionality and *obligations* in relationships. Are you *obligated* to continue a relationship with a kid that's not yours? **Of course not**. 

No one can make you. 

No one *should* make you.

62,sg7gvj,Many of the people who advocate for circumcision are fetishists that are doing it for their own sexual gratification,Itrusttheinternett,1643542803.0,7,0.58,11,"For those who do not know, circumsexuality is a fetish where people are sexually aroused by the act of circumcision and from what results from it.

Many circumsexuals enjoy desensitising their penis by removing all erogenous skin, except for the glans, and then they may go further to desensitise the glans using rubbing alcohol or even oven cleaner etc.

Many circumsexuals will cut themselves or have others cut them. Many are into the body modification scene. A classic example is Ferox Feminae on Twitter, I wouldn't advise looking her up.

Some circumsexuals enjoy reading/fantasing about/watching kids being circumcised, because neonatal circumcision is so widespread they don't have to try hard to find material.

Posts in our subreddit confirm all this.

People should be aware that those who advocate for circumcision may be circumsexuals acting out their ""kink"", and should have greater skepticism toward pro-circumcision claims.

[r/CircumsexualityXposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircumsexualityXposed/) is a place to catalogue these fetishists who take pleasure from thinking about harming others, and themselves.

It is hoped that our sub will provide evidence that circumcision reduces male sexual pleasure, and show how some circumcision advocates are motivated by sexual gratification.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017709E237F0>

I know a lot of people still think the benefits are great, but I think that only applies to wealthy and educated people. If you are not so wealthy, in a divorce case, your partner who is more wealthy can hire a better lawyer. 

For a lot of people who make more money, however, they may still lose out a lot. If a man makes a million dollars a year and had 9 million in savings, while the wife had 10k in her bank account, in a divorce, even if it isn't 50/50, one year or even a few years later, she gets part of it. 

Don't get me started on alimony. I think alimony should only exist if both had agreed one stays home and raise the kids. But even then, I think it's not a good idea. No one should stay home and raise kids but instead work. If you can't afford to hire a nanny, I think for your sake you shouldn't have kids. The reason is, what happens if the man doesn't pay you alimony? What if he leaves the country? What if he turns abusive and you must flee with the kids? In my opinion, all parents, male or female should think of this. A marital partner should be an addition that is nice to have, but not your better half. (Yes, this is unpopular opinions.) I think the idea that marriage is codependency is very bad. We should instill in children more to be self reliant.

I just don't get why we are so obsessed with getting married and defining what marriage 'is'. Like a lot of people still think a contract must last a lifetime. Why? If someone doesn't want to, that's their business. I think if you want it to last a lifetime, have a clause. Like 'if it lasts at least 20 years, even in divorce, you get half of our financial assets. Otherwise if less than 20 years, you get nothing'.

76,seqyox,"80s relationships are full of covert racism and abuse apologism historically and we all pretend otherwise because ""muh Stranger Things""",Thick-Nature8555,1643376945.0,0,0.09,5,"Here are some trends that I am seeing from casually watching 80s documentaries:
- The woman is usually pregnant before the marriage
- There is a ""European fantasy"" element to the wedding
- The guy is usually extremely abusive, but she feels that he'll ""change"" and ignores obvious red flags like asking her if she's Jewish for whatever reason
- He doesn't change and she goes back to her mother's place

Before you say that this is all conjecture, the rates of single mothers and so on have shot up drastically from the 80s. I think that this is a common theme that all of us can attest to in our lives. I think that 80s nostalgia prevents us from seeing how much our parents' generation sucked because ""muh Stranger Things.""

Here are a few plausible causes that I can think about:
- Princess Diana's wedding made ""commoners"" think that they were actually billionaires on hard times and a prince was coming to ""save"" them if they just ""behaved right""
- The depressions of the 70s were pushed out in favour of forced 80s positivity, which made many women overlook abuse
- It was an extremely strong trend for every woman to have blonde hair, which would have distanced women even more from other minorities and pushed them deeper into this ""European exceptionalism"" role
- As we all know, MTV manipulated the charts and destroyed music, often putting on trite boy-meets-girl music with no substance (music is a way of flexing the brain for children and, when no substance is given, nothing is learned)
- Women were determined not to marry because many of these parents divorced in the 60s and 70s during the 'free love' period
- There was a weird sex negativity at the time that might have contributed to this. All of the 80s women that I've talked to are extremely frigid and uptight like little girls. I wish that I was making this up. When I look back at historical figures from the 80s like Princess Diana, this seems to be a cultural thing. Something shifted from the 'free love' of the 70s to, ""Oh, no. Sex bad. I'm a sweet, innocent virgin with 3 kids out of wedlock""

What I want to know is what could make a rational, logical person fall for this stuff. Is it just the lack of internet and predominance of watered-down MTV and reality shows like The Cosby Show being the only type of education?

77,semmcf,I just really think it sucks that the only reason I and many others are left leaning is because we think all humans deserve basic respect and rights (VERY LONG POST),BoredomOccurs,1643361023.0,6,0.56,70," In general, I do not care about economics or war or trading or whatever the hell that politicians do in the White House. As long as I can live my life without government caused events interrupting me, then I will never care about politics.

The only reason a lot of people seem to care about politics is because things like race, lgbt+, misogyny, mental/physical disabilities, and things of the sort are treated as political. Every human being, no matter how different they are, deserves a basic amount of respect and rights. That is something that everyone just needs to hurry and agree on.

LGBT+ are people. If you don't like them, you treat them the same as you would treat a cis/straight person you dislike: You ignore them, you move on with your own life.

Minorities should be able to just exist in the media without people calling out how ""woke"" and ""forced"" something is. And the exact same thing goes for people with disabilities, whether physical or mental.

Women should be able to choose the things they want to do and to feel safe in society without being told that they want to ""kill all men"" or they're just being selfish. Feminism was originally about CHOICE. It was originally for a woman to be able to choose her own path in life. Not whatever is happening on Twitter. It was originally to let men know that we feel uncomfortable with constant, un-asked for sexual comments.

\-----

But unfortunately, if you talk about feminism now, you're called a 'Karen' by conservatives who don't even know the original definition for 'Karen' in the first place.

And if you say ""You know what? Gay people are people too, and they should probably be treated nicely :)"", you're called a 'Libtard'? For what? For acknowledging that different people still deserve respect? No one is hurting you personally, so why care so much about a gay person is up to?

If you say anything about race, mostly conservatives will say some weird stuff like ""Why complain so much? There are successful black people today."" Are you stupid? There were successful minorities during the peak of the civil rights movement, and even before that!

Did a small group of rich minorities stop the police from beating people in the streets during marches? Did a small group of rich minorities stop little black boys from being shot at simply for being black? And did a small group of rich minorities singlehandedly stop the growing poverty amongst most of the minorities in the U.S? You can apply this same logic to rich white folks today. Trump's family has been rich for decades. But does that suddenly increase the income in white lower-income families? Does Harry Style's wealth all of a sudden find a perfect home for poor white students who can't afford their own?

\-----

I do realize that because of the history regarding these subjects, they are deemed as 'political'. I really do understand.

But it just sucks so much that if you just think all types of humans deserve basic respect/rights, the right is just so quick to call you out? Human rights should NOT be political in any way! And if human rights weren't so political then I would be totally neutral on the subject of politics.

Even if you don't label yourself as 'liberal' or 'left', as soon as you talk about the above subjects, you are called a 'libtard' and made fun of. That's just so dumb. Human rights should not be political.

Politics should be about war, financing, economics, making the country better with jobs, schools and such. I'll even be lenient and throw in immigration as long as you're not being racist about it!",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770A2FB6A0>

really? you want one of the most corrupt politicians of all time back in office? a man who openly bragged about sexually harassing women? a man who wanted to build a wall to keep immigrants out of office? a man who allowed russia to interfere in an election and then tried to cover it up? a man who, when it became quite apparent that he had lost the election fair and square, incited an insurrection that ended many lives and ruined others?

If we live in a meritocracy and we all have equal opportunities what possible reason could there be for the fact that the average black family has the equivalent of one penny for every dollar that the average white family has?

Antisemitism is a very dangerous ideaology. It has lead to such legalized evils as the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity carried out by groups such as the Nazis which were the German socialist party.

It is exceedingly alarming that Kamala Harris would go to Honduras to show support for a leader being inaugurated whose running mate takes these dangerous viewpoints, on a likewise socialist platform to the Nazis.

Now we’ve got quarterback Aaron Rogers (a white man) lying about following medical protocol and whining about Joe Biden and somehow that’s fine (even though it’s only politically motivated). And yet the American right wing praises him as their darling.

As far as I can tell, people don’t like him because the media tells them he’s bad without providing convincing reasons for saying so.  (As an aside, I think the reason the media doesn’t like him is that he’s profoundly more boring than Trump and their ratings are plunging as a result.)

Just to jump in front of a few rebuttals that I think are dumb and uninteresting, (1) the president has very little control over anything with respect to the money supply (i.e. inflation) and (2) the Afghan withdrawal was never going to be pretty and we just needed to rip off the band-aid.  The admin could’ve done stuff around the edges to make those outcomes slightly better, but in the end not enough to change the big picture without passing new legislation.

Please don’t say “he’s old.”  He is old, but so are Trump, McConnell, Pelosi, Schumer and pretty much everyone else in the nursing home we call Washington, DC.

I mean, what could be cooler than squaring off against the Soviet tanks, MIGs, subs, short-range nuclear missiles, etc to hold off a Soviet invasion of western Europe?

But, times change, I'm older, the Soviet Union is long gone, many of the post-Soviet states have joined the EU, and NATO ....  well apparently NATO doesn't get CNN and didn't see the Berlin Wall come down because otherwise they would have declared victory and closed up shop 30 years ago.

And yet NATO is still around, and now they have a brand new mission  - defend post-Soviet states from other post-Soviet states.  So for example if Kazakhstan wants to invade Tajikistan, the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe will be like ""**NOT ON MY WATCH**"" and light them the fuck up. Why?   Nobody knows.

If you've studied any history at all, then you know that Europe's recent lack of conflict is a historical aberration.  You've heard of the hundred years war, right?  Since it was in Europe, it went sixteen extra years.  But that's nothing compared to, for example, the Roman wars with Persia, or the Crusades, which went on for more than 600 years.

Maybe now's a good time to pay attention to our own hemisphere so we don't end up with another Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, or Pablo Escobar.

122,s830li,Cersei Lannister isnt evil and its not even close (Show Cersei).,Jesperthemate,1642632644.0,2,0.6,9," Many might instinctively cringe at this opinion but hear me out. Let's go through the actions of Cersei and see if the sum of her actions and personality can be characterized as evil. 

**Season** 1

\- Her influence on Jaime pushing Bran out of a tower. 

It is difficult to know whether she truly wanted Jaime to push Bran as she didn't say so explicitly. But lets even assume she did want that, while the action is undoubtedly gruesome is it truly evil? if she wanted to push Bran it is not out of some ill intent towards him but because of self preservation for her and mote importantly her children, she knows that if Bran spreads her secret not only will she be killed, but all of heir children will be butchered by Robert Baratheon. Any mother in the same situation would have made the choice to save their own children if they had to. This does not make her evil. This is going to become a theme btw, Cersei does make gruesome decisions when forced into a corner with no way out. Though it can be argued that she isn't even responsible for this one.

\- Showing sympathy to Catlyn

Number two is a good deed. After Bran falls she shows sympathy to Catlyn and tells her about losing her first child. Small deed but this absolutely important for her character.

\- Killing Sansa's wolf (lady).

This undoubtedly looks like a cruel act, but if we try to remove our bias for cute puppies is it really?. First of all, she does it to correct the humility Joffrey suffered of being beaten by a girl and bitten by a wolf. Also, in the modern era we put down dogs who bite humans, which makes her action even more reasonable, and she doesn’t know whether Arya and the Wolf ambushed Joffrey or if Joffrey started the fight (which he did), as she wasn’t there. And she obviously believes her son before Arya. This reasonable justification is something I think differentiates her from the truly evil characters like Joffrey and Ramsay, they don’t need a justification for their actions. They are cruel for the sake of being cruel. And other characters like Tywin who I also consider evil have extremely flimsy excuses for their evil deeds, (Tywin is unnecessary cruel to Tyrion for his mother dying in childbirth, something he has no responsibility for. Tywin is extremely intelligent and knows deep down that Tyrion doesn’t have any responsibility which is why his continued cruelty is evil).

\- Having Robert killed.

If a friend you knew got physically abused, verbally abused, sexually abused, ignored and mocked for years would you think it was evil to kill the abuser? THE ANSWER IS NO, and that happened to Cersei. And furthermore, she once again only has Robert killed once she is forced into a corner where her children will be killed or hunted down for the rest of her life if she doesn’t as Ned is about to tell him her secret. 100% justified.

\- Being partly responsible for having Ned starks men killed in the Throne room. 

This is once again a fully justified action and it doesn’t just lie on her shoulders, Littlefinger and Janos Slynt both have some responsibility. Ned Stark is threatening to strip her and her children of all power, imprison them and to leave them at the mercy of Stannis Baratheon who would probably have them killed as they threaten his legitimacy if they should return to Tywin. Cersei gives Ned ample opportunity to swear loyalty to Joffrey and return to Winterfell, unharmed with all his men and both his daughters. This is an extremely generous offer considering he has already said he knows her secret. He rejects this and forces her hand; Ned stark is fully to blame for getting his men killed.

\- Trying to get Ned Stark to join the nights watch

This is a good deed, she is trying to avoid war and giving ned the opportunity to stay at the watch instead of rotting in a cell for the rest of his life. Once again, extremely generous.

\- Cersei tries to stop Joffrey from having Ned stark killed

Cersei does try to get Joffrey to stop the execution of Ned stark. Some ridiculously argue that she didn’t try hard enough. ZERO of the powerful people (Varys, Pycelle, etc) around Joffrey at the time manage to make him change his mind. This is a good deed as she is trying to avoid war once again.

**Season 2**

Now we have come to season 2. And in this season Cersei doesn’t do a single act that is even questionable. And no, being rude to Tyrion once after he joked about her incest isn’t evil. That’s verbal payback for being mocked. The same goes for being angry at him for basically kidnapping Myrcella. And while she imprisons Rose (because she believes Tyrion cares about her), she only does this to make sure Tyrion doesn’t hurt Joffrey, she immediately lets her go once Blackwater is finished and doesn’t torture her. So lets move on to good deeds.

Good deeds.

\- She gives Catlyn Ned starks bones back. Yes Tyrion suggests it, but she allows it (Which she has no reason to do if she is truly evil).

\- She gives Sansa advice and once again shows sympathy to her after her period. She recommends she has a child, so she gets some happiness in her life. Literally no other reason to suggest this other than being kind (and no she doesn’t care about Lannister legacy like Tywin does). 

\- She is clearly disturbed by Joffrey torturing prostitutes and being cruel to Sansa. Literally questioning whether Joffreys cruelness is a price for her incest. One of the most humane moments in the show.

\- She first lies to Sansa about Ser Ilynn being in Magors Holdfast to protect them as she doesn’t want Sansa to be scared. Only when she gets more drunk does she admit the truth (which obviously isn’t evil either).

\- She is about to kill Tommen when she thinks the battle is lost to spare him from the pain of Stannis killing her and him. 

SERIOUSLY TO DOUBTERS, LOOK AT ALL THESE GOOD DEEDS.

**Season 3.**

Cersei being Jealous of Margery

\- Yes Cersei is Jealous of Margaery, but she doesn’t say or do anything that is out of line before Margaery literally tries to manipulate her during Sansas wedding with the whole “lets be sisters”, Cersei realizes this and turns hostile as anybody would if they know they are being knowingly manipulated.

Cersei recommends Tyrion give Sansa a Child

\- Once again, a really good deed. No, she is not doing it to impress Tywin, it is made explicitly clear that she doesn’t care about his legacy in season 4. She does it because she wants Sansa to have some happiness in her life, an extremely good deed.

Cersei tries to stop Joffrey from verbally abusing Sansa at her wedding

\- Another good deed, she doesn’t like the unnecessary cruelty of Joffrey and tried to stop him from doing it.

Cersei is disturbed by Joffreys insistence of serving Rob Starks head to Sansa. 

\- Some would argue its just to attempt to control him, I totally disagree. If you watch the scence her smile evaporates once Joffrey shows his cruelty, and she looks disturbed and tries to talk him out of the idea.

**Season 4**

In this Season Cersei is a bit more questionable but nothing that rises to level of “evil”.

Cersei wants Pycelle to feed the leftovers of Joffreys weddings to the dogs.

\- This is just done out of Jealously, while it is certainly childish it isn’t evil.

Cersei wants to kill Tyrion

\- She truly believes he killed Joffrey, she is obviously wrong, but no parent is evil in my view for wanting their child’s killer dead. 

Cersei tells Tywin the truth about her incest.

\- This is a morally grey deed. Though I would say its mainly done out of love, she thinks he wants to steal and manipulate her son (which he basically does want).

**Season 5** 

Season 5 is more of the same.

Cersei imprisons Loras and is partly responsible for Margaerys imprisonment

\- Margery only has herself to blame, she mocks Cersei infront of an audience of girls. Insulting her drinking habbits, telling her about having sex with her son, rubbing in the fact that Cersei is no longer queen. And no this hostility isn’t just Cersei’s fault, Margaery started the hostility by attempting to manipulate her. And while it is once again childish of Cersei to imprison Loras, that’s really all it is. She just wanted some short term schadenfreude. She had no idea how powerful the faith militant would become and did not intend to start a war with the Tyrells. She is clearly ignorant in this situation, not evil.

Cersei rubs it in Margaerys face that she is in prison

\- Margaery did the same to her, enough said.

**Season 6**

Cersei kills a guy who flashes her in the lowest moment of her life. 

\- This guy literally sexually harasses her, and then continues to brag about it. She is the victim not him. Not evil.

Cersei blows up the sept.

\- I am guessing this is moment some might believe, aha gotcha. But no. Cersei tries every other option before resorting to this extreme. She tries to simply stay in the red keep and put it all behind her, that’s not enough for the faith as they demand she is put on trial, she tries to solve that by having a trial by combat, the high sparrow then manipulates Tommen into absolving Trial by combat and sends Jaime away so he wont be there to protect her.

\- When she has no other way out, her life is on the line. The city is ruled by religious fanatics who brutalize anybody who dissent she finally blows up the sept. She even saves her son who betrayed her. Also, if not for the faith militants stupidity Margaery and Loras might even have survived and another war could have been avoided. The absolute majority of the blame here is on the faith militant and the high sparrow who gave her no choice.

Cersei kills Pycelle

\- Pycelle is a disgusting man responsible for allowing Tywin Lannister to sack kings landing, he likes very young girls (though I am not saying he is interested in children), he manipulates Tommen and he stares at Cersei with a sexual smirk after she does her walk of atonement. Though killing him is cruel he is clearly a man who would betray her the first chance he got and also not a decent person. This act is cruel, I admit that. But one cruel act does not make one evil, especially considering the MANY good deeds she does.

**Season 7**

She mainly just rules as a monarch trying to defend her kingdom, defending yourself against an illegitimate and whiny invader like Daenerys is not evil in the slightest. Yes, she does kill the Sand snake (don’t remember her name) and the wife of Oberyn in a rather cruel way, however they literally killed her daughter just to start a war. Totally justified from Cersei. 

Cersei allows Olenna Tyrell a peacefull and painless death

\- Some of you might argue that since she even considered a cruel death for her enemy, she is evil. Absolutely not, it is precisely the fact that she is able to reconsider which makes her different from evil people like Joffrey who don’t. 

Cersei allows Jaime Lannister to leave her unharmed, even though he is betraying her by fighting with her enemies.

\- Once again, an extremely generous act considering what he is doing. Betraying her to fight for another house. And no it was absolutely justified by Cersei to not honour her pledge to fight against the white walkers. Daenerys (the spoiled brat) literally says she will invade her afterwards despite the help.

**Season 8**

Season 8 doesn’t count, and she spends her time staring out of windows and complaining about elephants. Season 8 sucks

In conclusion, while Cersei is certainly not good, and is perhaps one of the most flawed characters on the show she is still FAR from evil. She doesn’t enjoy cruelty to people who haven’t harmed her severely (like killing her child), she can often give good advice and show sympathy, she often tries to stop her son from being cruel, etc.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770BC0FA20>

125,s7q9xy,There is nothing wrong with natural medicine,IPodman12,1642599366.0,5,0.59,10," 

Natural medicine is a dying art. Let me start with this i cant really think of a  good way to cite evidence for this and this is my first post here. I  have seen so much stuff lately just shiting on any foam of alternate  treatment. I have even seen people throw hate for stuff that has  recognized heath benefits. For instance zinc, it is recognized to fight  various illness but as soon as covid its like it is some kind of witch  craft if you even suggest it may help. I mean god iv seen people crap on  the fact that many illness are just a lack vitamin. I have seen people  not able walk for a lack of vitamins, it seems stupid to for no one to  even consider something like taking vitamins for depression or at least  have the test done to see if you need any. But people take this stuff  like a person offense. They act like it is person attack to think that  such a 'complex illness' could be solved so easily. Im not against  traditional medicine or anti-depressants it just seems like if you can  solve it with less why wouldn't you. i mean hell look at what weed does  for seziers but thats ok because it ""modern medicine"" right?

To  me it just seems strange but there is a lot of stigma around the stuff  to. I mean i will admit i even go so far into it i use essential oils  and in many case they have help me heal up quick and ward off infection.  I have use them to help my burn heal (i have had many 3rd degree burns  from a brazing touch) they healed up in less than a week and a half. But  still i go to the doctor if i need i still went to the doctor when i  put a drill bit through my hand. I knew well enough that i needed so  traditional medicine so it wouldn't get infected. It seems dumb to shit  on something and act like a superior human since you rather just go  straight to synthetic compounds **(no im not talking about the vaccine I don't care if you want it or not its not my problem)**

It seems to boil down to these 3 points

1. Its all just junk/placebo
2. It's dangerous have seen what it dose to  xyz
3. There are no credible sources

Ill try to debunk them as best as i can

1. Most  stuff you get at your local sore is junk it is such a low dose of it if  is a vitamin or if it is some kind of oil it is a crappy chemical blend  like they use to scent candles. you have find a better dose of vitamins  (most drug store brands don't even come close to the max daily dosage)   or a reputable oil seller.
2. Yes  i have seen oils strip paint of my tool box yes i know to much vitamin d  can kill you. But you can disintegrate bone in coke and 6 advil can  kill you to. Its a non argument.
3. well  there are some but most aren't pure reviewed and the various heath  organization vary rarely will even credit anything enough to approve for  per review. Also i will argue when dealing with any medicine but  particularly more natural medicine what works for one isn't always good  for another. What works for me isnt may not enough or it may be to much  of something for you.

This  is my argument in favor of at least some further research and maby why  you may want to think twice before shiting on some ""science denying  loon"" for using some foam of natural meds.

129,s754iu,Russian Empire would have been a superpower no matter what,GJermans,1642532871.0,4,0.7,5,"Russian Empire is almost always said to be a backwards country. It is often said that Russia would have never industrialized as ""well"" as the Soviets did, they wouldnt have the ""freedom"" and the better life that the Soviets had! But it couldnt be further from the truth - Russian empire was geopolitcally and economically the China  of the early 20th century

As most revoliutions, they only change things in which the society was already heading. Soviet union didnt begin the industrialization - they only accelarated it. Russian empire built from 1864 to 1918 about 70 000 killometres! For a comparison, Soviets in a longer time built 51 000 km of railroads

Russian Empire was already one of the strongest countries in the world, before the soviets. One of the reasons for ww1 was a fear of the Russian horde by the germans. if i remember correctly, germans predicted(prob incorectly) that by 1916 Russia would have a bigger than german economy and strength.

Soviet union butchered and forced to obey its stupid rules to the russian people and espiacially ""inteligencia"". Before soviet take over, Russian empire strived in art, music and in other science. Soviet scientists were mostly succesful in physics and sucked in arts and other things that required a creative mind. But im gonna give credit to where its done - they made the country more literate and other advances in schooling. Not like the russian empire were having fastly increasing literacy before the soviets :)(in 1897 it had roughly 28% and in 1916 it had 56%)

Russian industrialisation was very messy. Anything that is forced is usually not healthy for a society as whole - Forced industrialisation, Forced Urbanisation(lowered the birthrate by a lot, but increased the GDP and quality of life, hell yeah!), forced  collectivisation, which was a ridicoulusly stupid. Colletivisation was a huge failure. It provoked So much resistance by peasants and kulaks that they burnt their own crops so commies wouldnt get it and the most succesful of farmers that didnt surrendered were shot or deported. Also another thing i want to add to soviet industrialisation is that they focused way too much on Heavy industry. Light industry sucked badly. Like really really badly. There was always lack of specific good in soviet union that were very hard to get, and some which were too cheap to get. That is mainly due to communism economics.

132,s6n99f,I am sick and tired of the taboo around visually sexualizing males the same way females are sexualized in media,,1642476126.0,14,0.63,61," Look, I get it. Males and females generally are sexualized differently, and have generally different physiology. But that being said, it feels like everyone in control of media have something against EVER showing us ANY exceptions to the rule. Movies, shows, comics, video games alike.  


So, you might ask - what do I mean with sexualizing males the same way females are visually? Well, it's many aspects that together form consistent double standards in sexualization. When was the last time you saw a sexy male character wear an impractical outfit meant to make them look sexy and not to be empowering or practical, and they make sexually suggestive poses not meant to be for fighting but to be titillating, and they show off their ass and legs with the camera angle or panel focusing on it, and they might even have skin-revealing clothes to show it off better, and they have a nice round ass at that?  


And please don't lecture me about how men and women are different - I get it, I've heard those arguments millions of times. But again, even IF that is the case, there are no exceptions to the rules. Outside of porn, you don't really get to see let's say a sexy femboy, twink, or even a more traditionally masculine man appear in this fashion.  


It's not that people don't want to see it either. Not only have I talked to tons and tons of people who wouldn't mind seeing it, but all the porn I've seen of it speaks in volumes too.  


Is it a big deal? Technically not. But for some reason, my brain obsesses over it. I struggle a lot with anxiety and depression, and my brain won't let go of things. Ever since I became aware of this double standard being a thing, I feel like I can see it everywhere. They overly emphasize female butts SOOO much more in every way possible than male butts.  


Yes, I know it's a weird obsession. But I can't help it. I wish I could. I wish I could just relax and stop thinking about it and focus on more important things. But, well, that's not how depression works, I'm afraid.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770BD96780>

134,s6jbay,National Self Determination is a horrible idea and I hate it.,chloeandvegas,1642464903.0,6,0.69,18,"This opinion is unpopular worldwide, especially in the international community. I think that the supposed “right” to “National Self Determination” is stupid. I hate anyone who supports it. For those who don’t known, this means that an ethnic group is entitled to its own nation. I think that this concept has enabled nationalism and this concept has devastated multicultural societies.

The entire world order is based around this idea, it’s even one of the stated core principles of the United Nations. This is the cause of so much civil war ethnic violence, Especially in Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. When people think that their ethnic group is entitled to its own nation and they don’t get their way then it drives people to start rebellions and civil wars which tear apart their multiethnic societies.

Just think of all the recent ethnic violence between ethnic groups in Yugoslavia, Sudan, Iraq, Cyprus, etc. where idiots thought that their ethnic group deserves its own nation? Honestly what good has this “self-determination” and all the little ethno-states that have come out of it caused? There hasn’t been that much ethnic violence throughout history. No one has ever really given a damn about ethnicity and multiple ethnic groups have (usually) lived together in the same state. Multicultural/Multiethnic societies are the norm throughout history, especially in the Middle East.

A lot of contemporary political analysts for example say that Iraq for example is unstable because it has Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurdish people living in the same nation and there is so much sectarian (ethnic) violence between these three ethnic groups. Yet what the political analysts forget is that all throughout Middle Eastern history, there have been large multicultural societies where different ethnic groups have lived (usually) together just fine. 

Liberals (in an international sense, not a US politics sense) push the idea of “National Self Determination” and then wonder why there is so much Nationalism. Liberals push an idea that promotes ethnic states and then wonder why there is so much Nationalism based around those ethnic states.

Ethnic separatists are enabled by liberals who romanticize the idea of “supposedly oppressed ethnic minority fights for freedom against evil majority ethnic group.” Ethnic separatists are NOT a good thing. I despise them. They tore apart Yugoslavia and many other impressive multiethnic societies.

I would also argue that the root cause of oppression and racism in the world is that the reactionary Nationalists from the dominant ethnic group are reacting to the ethnic separatists of the minority ethnic groups. If it wasn’t for the idea of “National Self Determination” there wouldn’t be so much ethnic violence in the world.

It’s time to stop being two-faced and oppose ALL Nationalism, no matter who it’s coming from. We need to realize that National Self-Determination and Multiculturalism are mutually exclusive and that NO ethnic group is entitled to its own nation and oppose anyone who believes in ethno-states.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770BE41898>

136,s5vc9u,"Blue Lives Matter and All Lives Matter never really cared about cops, let alone all lives in general. An obvious example of such is Mohamed Noor from Minneapolis, Minnesota.",StatisticianGreat514,1642395087.0,8,0.62,28,"There, I said it. And yes, I strongly agree with it. And this officer is a strong example of why. Here's the breakdown of it.

Mohammed Noor is a former Minneapolis, Minnesota cop who killed Justine Damond, a young yoga instructor. So here's the story. On the night of the shooting July 15, 2017, Damond called 911 to report a woman she thought was being raped. This resulted in two officers, one of them being Noor to be dispatched to the scene. But there was no evidence of such after the investigation. But then, Damond approached the squad car they were in and Noor fired his gun at her killing her in the process claiming that he feared for his life. This killing led to global outrage and he was eventually charged and sentenced, initially for 12 1/2 years but was now reduced to 57 months. That's the summary of what happened that night. But here's where things take an interesting, ironic, and hypocritical turn.

We've seen a lot of incidents regarding police brutality/shooting here in America where for the most part, the victims are ordinary Black citizens and the suspects are White cops. Such cases have pitted people in two groups, obviously Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter. When the trial for the cops are set, they are usually found not guilty of all wrongdoing. According to Black Lives Matter, they think the killing was unjustified for whatever reason. For Blue Lives Matter, they think the victim should've complied and that the cop was doing his/her job.

Now let's cut to the chase. This particular police shooting is significant as the cop is a Black Somali Muslim immigrant and the victim was a White Australian immigrant. Do you think Blue Lives Matter will support the former? The answer.......was surprisingly, NO. Instead, they supported the innocent victim. And as a result, the narrative was flipped upside down and a new one emerged. Many people, particularly on the Right (which Blue Lives Matter is usually supported by) have grown critical of the officer who they believed was fast tracked due to affirmative action. They even brought up past allegations of misconduct made by him. This abrupt change in tone has caused many people, most notably social justice activists/Black Lives Matter to question how certain victims of police are usually portrayed by the media with White victims being labeled innocent and Black victims being labeled as villains. They even predicted that if the officer was convicted, it wouldn't be surprising at all. And yes, if you're wondering Black Lives Matter along with other groups marched in support for Justine Damond.

So here's my conclusion, the fact that Blue Lives Matter isn't coming to the support of the officer in this particular case goes to show that it's a sham organization cause obviously, not all Blue Lives matter with this guy being one of them. They always say the same thing about Black Lives Matter but not in the case with their own group. It also debunks their belief that All Lives Matter as well as the Conservative message that they don't see color and see everyone as equal because obviously this wasn't the case here due to their accusations of affirmative action against him. In fact, in my opinion when I hear them say that they don't see color, they obviously mean they only see White as White isn't a color.

\*To close off, I support Justine Damond and I continue to support every act of justice for her and her family as they continue to grieve her tragic and unjustified loss.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770BEE24A8>

- There are at least two pictures floating around online of Charles Darwin signaling that he is a member of a secret society that is known for their belief that Lucifer is God.
- The purpose of ""The Origin of Species"" was to guide society towards a mass atheist movement.
- When the ""Theory of Evolution"" was first introduced, two of the main points were that life started from a primordial soup and that man was descended from monkey.  These two ideas were then intentionally used as evidence that God must not exist.
- The ""primordial soup"" premise was dropped from the theory of evolution and made into a separate branch of science called abiogenesis - which has made zero progress and essentially dead ended at takeoff.  The idea that we evolved from monkeys has also become essentially obsolete.
- The news that dinosaur fossils had been found across the globe was also used as a way to induce a mass atheist movement.  Dinosaurs can be placed in the same category as gods when it comes to actual proof and evidence that they exist.  Sorry paleontologists, you're the Mormons of science.
- The theory of evolution has spent over a century continuously moving the goalposts.  It's like trying to forcefully shove a square hole through a round peg.  They have spent so much time and effort trying to make the idea of evolution real.  A great example of the scientific method in use!
- Evolution has been widdled down to nothing more than the fact that things adapt to their environment over time.  Wow, mind is blown.
- Changes in allele frequency do not suggest progress being made, but rather a back and forth reaction to environmental factors causing small changes, and then many years later changes to changes.  There is nothing there to create advancement into complexity.  Adaptation does not require the advancement into complexity, not does it provide anything to be directed towards this.  Evolution is a process akin to ""getting something for nothing"".
- The guided, intelligent evolution of the wolf failed to introduce complexity  not an advancement in intellect.  How was nature able to do this by sheer coincidence?
- Upon discovering DNA it was declared that ""it appears to be a set of instructions"".  Instructions denote intelligence.  DNA has also been compared to ""a living language"" and ""biological programming"".  
- There is no evidence for common ancestry, only misinterpretations of the fossil record.  The tree of life and common ancestry are not real.

I am in favor of researching this technology at all costs. I don't care if we need to pay poor people to get experimented on. I don't care if scientists use orphans as unwilling test subjects. I don't care if people make test tube babies specifically for the purposes of editing their genes.

141,s5ff9a,"The Right should not complain about identity politics and victimhood when they practice the same damn thing. In fact, they created them. So them screaming such nonsense to their base is another sign of their desperate projection and lack of personal responsibility which they claim to preach a lot.",StatisticianGreat514,1642350613.0,4,0.58,22,"Remember the cliché-ridden arguments from the Right that they make about the Left about identity politics and victimhood? Some of popular arguments are that they patronize minorities by making them think one way and brainwash them on so-called victim mentality and oppression, as well as judging people by the color of their skin instead of their character. I personally agree with them that victimhood and thinking one way shouldn't be required and that character does matter. But at the same time, I think the Right should practice what they preach and implement those arguments to themselves because to this day, they're not doing that. And what I mean by that is that they too have their own form of identity politics and victimhood.

Some examples of such are centered over the demographics and values of their base. Obviously, the party is around 85-90% White, Christian, Straight, and Evangelical. And then when such changes are happening in society, particularly a desire to become more inclusive and progressive in society, they feel constantly victimized. We got people like Tomi Lahren complaining about Wars on Straight White Males, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter, and Nick Fuentes complaining about demographics, Evangelical and GOP leaders complaining about an LGBTQ, Muslim agenda being implemented, as well as the War on Christmas bullshit, etc. The recent controversy over the national GOP accepting members of the LGBTQ community (Log Cabin Republicans) has caused many state GOP leaders to condemn it. And speaking of my last comment about content of character that Conservatives love to preach, whenever Right-Wing media outlets like Fox News and Breitbart report crime stories done by minorities, in particular Black people, the comments are usually filled with racist comments like the N-Word, 13%, and other outrageous stereotypes. Go onto the GOP's recent page when they posted Black History Month, so much White Grievance in the comments. The same can be said about the GOP's recent page wishing Muslims a Happy Ramadan. Nothing but Christian persecution mentality and Evangelical hokum. Furthermore, they always say that Blacks have a plantation mentality and are incapable to think for themselves because of the Left.

Hearing and reading this, I really wonder if these guys ever listen to what they're saying? In fact, are these the same guys that love to preach against so-called Leftist identity politics and victimhood? Because it obviously seems like the opposite is in play here and they fail to see the irony of such. In fact, with their constant ranting and raving over such culture issues and engaging in such semantics, they're engaging in their own form of identity politics. One that is much more worse and hypocritical than the Left's. And as they continue to ostracize these communities, they continue to profess confusion as to why they think one way. Here's my answer to their troublesome ignorance: They think one way for a very important reason and it definitely wasn't on-purpose. It's because you constantly berate them to the point that they start to radicalize and as a result, they think collectively and start embracing their identities more. Once you pull the trigger on them, they'll fight back. In other words, turn around, fair play. And as a result, they'll start using classic slurs like Uncle Tom, Coconut, etc. and start bashing Straight, White Males and Evangelicals. Hence, you are personally responsible for what happens when you engage in the culture war.

This is why I laugh and find it cringeworthy that the Right preaches against identity politics. It exists because of them. It's their creation. This is why your party is predominantly White and it's ironic that you preach against such a notion when you don't look at the makeup of your own party. They created this and they should own this. After all, you are the party of responsibility, you should own this. If they really don't want identity politics to exist, they should actually see them as equals and not inferiors. And that will happen if they denounce all the attacks their fellow members on the Right make about them. That includes denouncing all the Republicans who pulled the birther movement on Obama among all the other racist and bigoted comments against him and his family. To me, that is going to be an uphill battle because if they do that, they will be considered as woke, panderers, and virtue-signaling. Even worse, they'll be called Cucks, which I addressed in a recent post on this sub as the White Conservative version of an Uncle Tom. In my opinion, a huge double standard. Not only that, they shouldn't sheepishly hide behind the First Amendment as a shield when such incidents happen because it will lead some people to believe that they indirectly support it. If you have a problem with those terms being used, too bad. Remember, we're not supposed to be politically correct. Ever since the election of President Trump, political correctness has been placed in the trash. But what you failed to realize is that it goes both ways.

How would you like it if I say that White Evangelical Conservatives have a victimhood mentality and a persecution fetish and they are slaves to the Republican plantation with no ability to think for themselves. See where I'm going? Funny how that works. These guys love to play victim of discrimination yet they are extremely overrepresented in that party. I for one would like people to be judged as individuals, but if one party constantly preaches that yet goes against it every time like what the GOP does, they need to do a little soul-searching and rebranding. That's my honest opinion on such a controversial issue like this. What do you think?

Can he create a stone that he cannot lift? That isn’t a “thing”, that is logically impossible, so what will happen isn’t something you can imagine or process or name.

Can he kill himself? He doesn’t, there is no can or cannot, there is just does. We are talking about an entity that is beyond the concept past-present-future. An entity that doesn’t really want, like us, cuz he is beyond causation, it’s just another law of universe that HE CREATED.

What God did or doing or will do aren’t different.

If he is omniscient, free will doesn’t exist. Why? Is he not powerful enough to force that? 
Can’t he even write what you’ll do like a book, but Set the “writing” as effect, and your actions as cause?

It doesn’t have to make sense, again, that’s just logical, since he is beyond a rule that he created.

Please think about what you are talking about guys.

If God is bound by logic, then there is some external crap called free will that is the reason of evil, and God can’t control that since it is logically impossible for some reason, and we cant judge him.

Or God is simply the infinity and there is no argument that needs God to be logical.

Edit: I don’t think we can prove or disprove God exists, since like someone said “he is beyond our fish brain” this doesn’t mean he doesn’t exists, or that this doesn’t prove agnosticism.

159,s3kcqn,Sometimes schadenfreude is necessary to prove a point about the seriousness of certain issues because many people display arrogance in the face of danger until it affects them. The Herman Cain Award which tracks COVID deaths is one example as it keeps track of how people don't take it seriously.,StatisticianGreat514,1642137869.0,4,0.63,34,"No one wants to take pleasure in someone getting sick from a certain illness and dying because of it, especially from a virus such as COVID.

Would you mourn them, consider it karma, or both? I'd do both and what better way to express it than with the Herman Cain Award.

And when that term is used, Conservatives particularly White Conservatives get offended and up in arms criticizing them for being racist for supposedly stating that they should be thinking one way. But what they fail to realize is that they use very similar terminology to describe Whites who vote Democrat or are Conservatives who have moderate views on certain social issues like race, religion, gender, sexuality, and of course immigration. Such examples of terminology are ""cuck"", ""beta male"", ""soy boy"", and ""girly boy"". The first term is the most common among the four. Some people have stated that these are alt-right terms and that they are not common among Conservatives, but if you check out Conservative outlets like Breitbart, Fox News, etc., the users use those terms a lot to describe any White who they see as self-hating, having so-called ""White Guilt"", and voting Democrat, as well as any Conservative pushing a diversity agenda or so-called ""pandering"" as they see it. Seems like they have made themselves mainstream by the sound of things. Reading these comments, I can't help but wonder the hilarious and hypocritical irony behind this.

India isn't the only one. Across Africa and Asia, western imperialists have ruined entire nations and rendered them dirty poor slums. I don't care or give a fuck about HOW but these European colonial powers must pay repatriations, even if it is at the cost of their own economies. 

I might sound cold and bitter, but I'd gladly take back the 45 Trillion USD's that Britain stole from my country, even if it means the British population suffers from famines and economic collapses. Britain killed millions in the Bengal famine, not to mention the countless other cases of artificial famines, so it's fair that Britain suffers its share of suffering. The same is true for other European powers.

Sorry to say it, but the entire western world and the broad anglosphere has been built upon the suffering of Indians, Africans, Chinese, and countless other peoples.

I understand the consent angle being a little shady, but the reality is that it's harmless and has literally zero effect on sex life. Unironically comparing to fucking Chinese foot binding is hard to take seriously.

To be fair though Reddit also opened me up to the fact that there are a lot of cheap shady 'doctors' who do it in some part of the world, so I guess it might be a privilege of being in a culture where those don't exist.

That being said, while I'm not religious at all, I think doing for religious practice is a lot more valid a reason than doing it for 'cosmetic' purposes.

178,s01rcx,Abortion is always the best outcome for any pregnancy,existentialgoof,1641762900.0,1,0.52,38,"I've participated in many debates concerning abortion, and one thing that all pro-lifers, and even many pro-choicers seem to agree on, is that abortion is a tragic loss of life. But this argument doesn't make any sense to me if one presupposes that conscious experience is something that can only be formed in a living brain and that any conscious awareness that may exist in a ZEF would be of the most rudimentary variety.

Think about it. If your mother had chosen to abort you, then you would not have even known about it, and would never have had the opportunity to desire anything that life could offer you. You would also have been spared any suffering that would inevitably arise as part and parcel of being a conscious entity. So abortion prevents all the bad, without really imposing the loss of the good (because the 'good' was never desired to begin with, and a corpse can no more desire the goods of life than any other clump of inanimate matter).

As you'll have probably guessed, my mother chose not to have an abortion. As a consequence of that decision, I am now a slave to basic biological needs that were imposed on me without my consent, and I need to work 5 days a week at a demoralising and stressful job that I detest just in order to meet those needs (and hope that there is no serious adversity that hits me out of the blue) and truthfully, spend much of the other 2 days dreading the long 5 day gauntlet that awaits me ahead. And society broadly tells me that I'm insane if I'd want to end this drudgery in favour of a return to the harmlessness of non-existence, and then claims that because I'd have to be certifiably insane not to want to endure another several decades of this, they need to act in my best interests by preventing me from accessing some lethal drug or gas that would end my suffering instantly and without pain. If I'd have been aborted, my mind wouldn't be floating around in some limbo, lamenting and resenting the fact that I wasn't given the opportunity to be a cog in the capitalist machinery.

Even if you believe that abortion is a serious harm because death is a harm, it is still by far the lesser harm, considering that once a living organism exists, death is inevitable. So you do not prevent death by preventing abortion. You merely postpone it, and force that organism to go through what could potentially be a severe imbalance between pain and pleasure before dying, and ensure that death itself will probably be drawn out and painful, and the person will be terrified of their own mortality whilst approaching death.

All in all, there's just not a lot to be said ethically in favour of the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, by any metric except for ones that take into consideration the future of the economy (and demographic imbalances that might result). That's why I am not pro-choice.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770D689160>
179,s00khn,Miranda Sings is not an ableist character,1BoiledCabbage,1641759759.0,0,0.31,31,"Recently, I read an article talking about how Miranda's characteristics and personality make her an an ableist character. I read it through, now I'd like to give my point by point reasons as to why she *isn't*. 

The character of Miranda Sings, was originally based off the ""cocky teenage female singers"" on YouTube, but has afterwards, flourished into who she is today. 

The Miranda we know now is cocky, selfish, a know-it-all, sheltered and spoiled. Basing those around her in off of Haters Back Off, she has an absentee father, a mother with critical attention seeking isses & munchausen syndrome, a sister that doesn't want to be associated with her what-so-ever, an immature uncle who validates her behavior for online views and a love interest that ignores her behavior, because he's obsessed with her. 

Miranda is homeschooled..by who? No one, apparently. She has 4 horrible examples of people in her life, without learning anything factual. So when the only two ""positive"" influences in her live validate her every thought and move, she's going to:


1. Not have the complex vocabulary that other 17 year olds have


2. When corrected with grammar or information (as youtubers have done hundreds of times) she will deny any wrong doing and insist that she's right, youtubers give up and in doing so, it only solidifies her belief in that she could never be wrong. ""Pentatonix"" and ""Graceffa"" were tongue twisters for her, much like people who are unable to say ""Abominable"" or ""Aluminum"" 


3. Think that she's a professional at everything she tries and ""succeeds"" at once, in her mind. (she mentioned in the sing along challenge with Hannah Hart that if you aren't good at something the first time, stop trying), So she'll list off ""who she is"" - singer, actor, model & magician.


4. Bouncing off of that, she's horrible at all of these professions, which is the whole point of her videos. Making fun of people who are arrogant and believe they are the best at what they do, refusing to take any pointers, refusing to be corrected and getting upset when argued with. 


5. She's not necessarily ""slut shaming"" just to shame people. Miranda is a hardcore Christian, which is mentioned in several earlier videos. This was to make a joke out of religion itself. She insists on not making things porn, that drinking alcohol is a sin, lying is a sin and so on, but has blatantly contradicted herself in multiple videos, after being caught by the very people she shamed for doing these things. 

6. Uncle Jim was never a pervert towards Miranda. The whole point in Uncle Jim's story was heavily misconstrued, because Miranda accidentally made him out to be one, throughout the time she mentioned him and the people around her assumed he was her real uncle. Originally, Uncle Jim turned out to be Miranda's mom's orange tabby cat. (Hence loving to cuddle, being Miranda's ""first kiss"", knocking over Miranda's chia pet, Miranda suggesting he'd like a random piece of clothing that she'd get and not want for Christmas etc.) 


7. Miranda is weird and rude around others because she's sheltered and hadn't had a lot of socialization in the first 17 years of her life. 


Colleen had mentioned before that her and her brother Chris had sat down and made out a very detailed character with a full story of who she was and was surrounded with. Miranda Sings was never an ableist character and it's really quite disappointing when someone who clearly didn't do their research, assumed that she is. In short: she's is an uneducated, isolated, know-it-all with a god complex. That's all.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770D739320>

I would personally argue that between consenting¹ adults² who are both aware of the situation³ and who don't desire biological children⁴, incest is just a relationship like any other.
It's not because they can't have children that their relationship isn't ok. Gay relationship are fine, infertile people are allowed to be in relationship and people with hereditary diseases are too.
Moreover, the fact that they were raised together doesn't make their relationship inherently toxic or manipulative. It might be difficult for love to form under these circumstances, but if it forms, i don't see reasons to oppose it. 
If it personally makes you sick, maybe this is a you problem ? A lot of people find disgusting to be gay, to eat meat, to eat eyes,  to call your partner daddy, but those things are allowed, and moral. If you don't like it, it doesn't make it bad.
I can't think of any other arguments against it, nor can any people I spoke to about this, so it should be moral, right ? 
A lot of people will argue that whether you can find arguments for something to be moral doesn't make it moral, moral is subjective, and that's true, to a degree. I don't think this is how law should work, and even if you don't personally approve of it, you should let it be.

I am not attracted by any of my relatives, but it's really annoying to hear people periodically shitting on fans shipping people who are related to each other. If you're fine with shipping culture, there's no reason to shit on those ships.

a couple weeks ago, i made a post on r/unpopularopinions wherein i casually referenced that i like my little pony. although most of the comments on that post were on topic, one of the commenters said that the fact that i like my little pony is ""disturbing"". what? what did i do? the mere fact that i enjoy a show that just so happens to not be aimed at the same audience as me is disturbing. to be fair, i know where this commenter is coming from. there are a couple of my little pony fans who take their love of the show and it\`s characters...a bit too far. however, i am not one of those fans. i just watch the show, enjoy myself, and then go about my day. that\`s about it. it\`s kind of a douchy thing to decry a whole fandom as a bunch of creepy weirdos because of a few bad eggs.

and then there\`s just the whole thing about how show\`s aimed at younger audiences can be enjoyed by anyone. most of my favorite shows are aimed at a slightly younger audience then i but i still manage to enjoy them because they have characters and themes that appeal to me. my little pony is the same way.

i will not apologize for enjoying my little pony or any show for that matter. i will not apologize to conform to a sexist society who tries to keep the different genders ""in their place"". if you think me harmlessly enjoying a tv show is ""disturbing"" that\`s your problem and i\`m gonna do us both a huge favor and not associate with you. you are clearly not someone i want to devote my time to. i\`m gonna get hate for this and, to be blunt, i really don\`t care. i like me and i have a bunch of people in my life that like me. i\`m not gonna change so deal with it or get the fuck out.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770D85AF98>

191,ry0z70,"Hermione Granger marrying Ron Weasley, and not Harry Potter, makes perfect sense.",Ridley_Rohan,1641537428.0,5,0.59,6,"For one thing, Harry Potter was well within the friend zone.   Ron always managed to stay on the border with all the sulking and arguing.

Those who point to the similarities between Hermione and Harry seem to be trying to pair up brother and sister rather than two lovers.  Lovers are not about sameness.  They are about complimenting each other's differences as well preventing boredom with eachother.  Ron and Hermione together were a fountain of drama.   Harry and Hermione together were calmer and more forgiving.   They were of similar character being hardworking, serious, focused on the future, and altruistic.

Next, Hermione was NOT a naturally rebellious person.  Her natural instinct is to be a complete goody-two-shoes.  Out of pure intelligence dictating the necessity of it, she often rebelled.   But she was going against her own character.

And those females of the goody-two-shoes character type tend to go for the willful bad boy.   We can see this clearly with her choice of Crookshanks as a pet, the absolute most annoying cat in the world that nobody else wanted.   We also see it in her love interest Victor Krum.   Who was more of a willful bad boy, Harry or Ron?   Clearly it was Ron.

AND Herminone always was the helpful type.  Look how she kept trying to help house elves who didn't want it.  Look how she was always helping Hagrid despite it seeming to be a complete waste of time and energy to everyone else.  She was so often helping Ron and Harry to do anything at school.  And who needed help more and more often?   Harry or Ron?   Clearly it was Ron again.

However you feel about Ron, he had character.  He was very real.  He was often selfish, and even cowardly.   He was generally focused on right now, and had some good observation skills for it. He could be really stupid sometimes, but he wasn't just plain stupid.  He had talent in chess and on the Quiddich pitch, but he had anxiety issues. He was flawed.   But he had talent that he unleased with a little help from his friends...and he made Hermione KNOW shew as needed,  even when Ron was rejecting her....cause Hermione really was that smart to see the truth.

Last, never underestimate the bond of shared trauma, and they went through a lot.  And that's why it was either Harry or Ron, and not some random Victor Krum again.

Fact is, JK Rowling may herself disagree with her own decision in this.  But JK Rowling is such a genius deep down that maybe she cannot even understand her own genius analyzing it from the surface.    I believe she made her choice from what her gut told her.   And her gut made that choice from what we see all the time.  We ALWAYS see couples that don't immediately make sense to us, so Ron and Herminone not making immediate sense to us MAKES SENSE on that level alone.   But the subconcious often realizes deep things we don't see at a glance, and I have already illustrated what those are.   JK Rowling may just now not be able to consciously see what her subconscious mind saw clearly 25 years ago.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770D7A2F60>

196,rx2ylw,The reason men go to jail a lot more isn't because of judicial sexism.,theinspector5,1641434082.0,22,0.66,28,"One common myth I see a lot of ""men's rights"" types (and even feminists every now and then) regurgitate is that the reason there are 6-7 times as many incarcerated men is that judges are unduly harsh towards men they sentence and/or unduly lenient to women. This is wrong.

Men go to jail more because of behavioural differences between men and women at the population level. For one, men tend to have far more aggressive and confrontational personalities than women. While men are more predisposed to using verbal or physical aggression, women are more likely to utilise [relational aggression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_aggression), which is far more indirect and crucially does not involve any kind of criminal act.

Another factor here is that men on average are more willing to make reckless life choices for the prospect of a reward and are harder to deter with the threat of negative consequences. Women are known to be [more risk averse when it comes to things like finance](https://www.city.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2019/10/women-dislike-financial-risk-taking-research-finds) for example, so it's not hard to see why the prospect of jail time would have a greater effect on their behaviour.

Yet another cause of the disparity might even be anger management. While men and women both feel anger to the same degree, [women are actually better at anger management than men](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97882&page=1), possibly due to differences in brain structure. Since anger is the emotion that often drives violent and aggressive behaviour, it makes sense that men finding it harder to control would commit more crimes like assault and battery.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770D7C4E10>

Karl Popper once famously said that in order to maintain tolerance, we must be intolerant of the intolerant which he called the Paradox of Intolerance.  By going to far I mean those who want to use the freedoms we have in the West to subvert freedom itself.

Also let's make it perfectly clear: there is a differnce between someone who fights for real change in society and authentic social justice (for example, waiters getting paid a living wage) and the alt-right charicature of a SJW.  The first exists in real life, the second is an invention of the alt-right to smear progressive Americans who think different than them.

Anyone who makes a big deal about hating SJW's over anything else spends too much time being annoyed on the Internet. Most of these folks don't run into anybody that actually challenges their viewpoint. Many right wing people throw about the term SJW like it's the ultimate insult, as if the person in question should feel small about it but why should they? This term seems to be used to describe basically just about anyone that speaks up on behalf of the rights of others, particularly if that group is being persecuted. So, actually, good for anyone that does that. Caring about your fellow humans believe it or not is actually a 'good quality' and standing up for them is good too. Personally I've been called a right-winger by leftist tankies and an SJW by alt-right chuds so I actually find both funny.  When I get called either I just say thanks very much.

Over the years, I've come to realize that Anti-Sjws are some of the most delusional, half-witted, ironic, and whiny group of people there are. I see more Anti-Sjws complain about SJWS than I actually ever see SJWS. And say what you will about SJWs, but at least their values are morally righteous.

How many times do you post something, completely innocent, and just get BOMBARDED with random downvotes - but not a single reply? Not a single person even remotely explaining what the problem is?

I've seen comments that go -5 with only a couple of replies, and those replies often end up positive.

People on Reddit like to feel bigger than they are by downvoting people that they have NO intention on engaging with. Point it out, and you're usually downvoted even harder.

Nah. That's stupid. If you want to hide my or anybody else's posts with mass downvoting, you better be 100% prepared to explain what your problem is with the topic at hand. No exception. No wussing out. Give your feedback, and press whatever button you want - But you don't get to decide whether a post lives or dies without contributing at all to the conversation.

Think about how many Subreddits have the disclaimer - ""Only downvote posts that don't contribute to discussion"". Seems like half of the subreddits have it these days.

But the problem isn't the downvoting. Never has been. Downvoting for an opinion is fine, so long as you share that opinion, and contribute to the topic in ANY meaningful way. People who just downvote and ditch are probably the worst reddit has to offer.

This post was downvote-spammed on /r/UnpopularOpinion, despite the comments pretty much universally disagreeing with the opinion.

I think that the people reading it who normally just downvoted and left started replying because they were called out, and ended up exposing the fact that the voting was going against the spirit of the subreddit.

Then, the moderation (Not sure how, maybe via a bot) removed the post for being a ""Repost"" later on despite being a fairly unique take on voting.

However, for the most part, the reason why it is so important to have a degree is mostly because people typically don't have a chance at getting a job unless they can check the degree box.

Learning can be done elsewhere, outside of college, for a much lower cost. But the learning doesn't seem to count unless a degree is conferred.

One could be a mathematics genius, but they would have a very low chance at getting a job as a mathematician, because they don't have a degree.

One might be an expert self-taught programmer, but they would have trouble getting a job as a developer, because they don't have a CS degree.

Someone might be extremely good with numbers and banking, but they couldn't become an accountant, because they don't have a Business degree.

You get the point.

And in order to get a degree, they need to pay an enormous amount of money and likely only spend half their time studying their field (because the other is spent doing gen-eds that don't help their career).

It would be much better if people had the option of avoiding college by self-studying their field, saving everyone a large amount of time and money.

This would be a maximum of an additional 1%. So if a business engages in multiple regulated industries, they'd pay the same 1+1%.

basically, the government shouldn't be involved in any way in anyone's day to day life. It's an incredibly inefficient money pit, and money is the product of people's lives and effort.

If a company needs a government bailout, so long as that bailout hasn't been paid back, their products and services would be free to taxpayers. Obviously this would instantly bankrupt the company, and their assets would easily be bought up by a company that isn't incompetent.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770DB248D0>
224,ru0ev0,any systen can be 'justice'.,WaterDemonPhoenix,1641094191.0,0,0.5,14,"In my opinion, there is no objective justice. Yes, I can call you a pig for your system of justice. But objectively, you aren't wring, and neither am I. I personally don't think that justice is something any of us can agree on.

Some say death penalty isn't justice. Some say it is.

For me, if someone wronged me, not only should they go to jail, they should pay any expense to make me go back to the state I was in. including happiness. And if an eye for an eye makes me happier, I don't see a problem. Now you could argue you don't like that system. That's fine. I'm not saying you can't feel that..

My issue is when people say 'revenge isn't justice'. I ask what is justice. and why not? if the tribe of 50 all 50 people agree should anyone steal They must work for the person they stole from for 20 days.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770DB4E198>

Everywhere they're implemented more forcefully more infections rise, and on a psychological level they make you see others as less than human and more as vectors for disease.  

I really hate how this pandemic has made it so that if you question what the higher ups say you're a selfish ignorant idiot, and I hate being forced to wear something that shortens my breath and heightens my anxiety and claustrophobia.  And next to no one validates my anxiety because ""it's for everyone's health"" and ""the experts say it helps"", well if I get anxious and depressed so that you don't get the sniffles, that's a hell of a tradeoff.  I don't see the use.

And don't give me that ""if I can do it, so can you"" bullcrap.  I'm not you.  I'm me. Period.  If you want to wear it, fine, do what makes you comfortable, but if my comfort and mental wellbeing brings you discomfort, here's your hat and there's the door.  

Say what you want, but I will keep this stance to the grave and nothing in heaven or on earth will change my mind.  The Chinese Communist Party and all their patsies can burn in hell.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770DBCD9B0>

229,rtcz1f,It's not selfish or ablest to suggest shielding as an alternative to restrictions to protect the immunocompromised.,theinspector5,1641016931.0,3,0.6,5,"With it becoming increasingly clear that Omicron is far less severe than previous variants while transmitting at a far greater rate, it's now extremely questionable if restrictions are still justified or even effective. One thing those still still stuck in March 2020 still keep going on about is the implications for the immunocompromised. It seems a lot of hardline restrictions advocates think that not wanting to force everyone else to sacrifice over 2 years of their lives is rooted in selfishness and a disregard for the welfare of disabled people. It's not.

If you're immune system is so weak and unable to benefit from vaccination that even Omicron is a likely death sentence, you just have to shield. I take no pleasure in saying that and I wish there was a viable alternative, but if that applies to you then you just have to until Omicron blows over.

The original strain and subsequent Delta variant were severe enough to warrant restrictions, and restrictions were also effective enough against them to be worthwhile. Omicron's characteristics, combined with the cumulative negative side effects of restrictions, means the cost:benefit ratio has shifted.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770DD17588>
230,rt9m6p,Social media owners and technocracts have no right to ban anyone for any opinion,RandomDude1483,1641004794.0,7,0.62,14,"1. Context
I recently posted a screenshot if 60%+ of comments being deleted in a stonetoss comic (stonetoss is an extrenly racist bigot and a literal holacaust denier), but I kept getting comments saying those comments were right to be deleted.

People assumed a bunch of power mods given social privilage by the CEO knew exactly what counts as racist and what doesn't, were deleting posts with good intent and without even knowing what was said.

2. Why any moderation on opinions is harmful
•who gets to decide what is allowed and what isn't?
•the bigots will keep being bigoted in a more extreme echochamber where even less people are able to hear counter arguments and reason.
•fence sitters will eventually need to be able to hear why the cheap catchphrases are misleading,   for example if you ban all people bringing up crime statistics those who have never heard of this will not find out about the much bigger link between state caused poverty(segragation), genetic poverty  and crime because no one can respond with such counter arguments.
•I hate the thought of being censored myself
•It goes against the 1st amendment, EU's constitution, UK's mess of 8 documents, each individual EU member state's constitution, Canada's constitution, Australia's constitution, Japan's constitution etc. And just cuz it's a company censoring and not the government doesn't matter, does just as much harm.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770DD1B208>

However, I've noticed that the way people on the right often use the term is to call any instance of someone publicly expressing liberal or leftist opinions on social issues virtue signaling. The hypocritical thing about this is that regular conservatives and conservative political speakers, politicians and celebrities express their opinions on what they consider to be virtuous all the time, but it's somehow only virtue signaling when people on the left do it 

My point is that they've turned the term virtue signaling from a term with an actual meaning to a tool to completely dismiss someone on the lefts opinions",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770DD53390>
