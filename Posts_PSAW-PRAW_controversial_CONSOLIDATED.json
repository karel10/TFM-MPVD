wing liberals usually think that ethnicity is something one can choose or that it\u2019s entirely a cultural thing, while ethnicity is certainly cultural to a very large extent that isn\u2019t the only aspect of it, it\u2019s also a matter of ancestry, if a French man and a Russian woman have a kid born and raised in Germany that kid will **not** be ethnically German in any way, a German citizen? Yes, of course. Culturally German? Very much possible. **Ethnically** German? No, ethnically can\u2019t be chosen, if you\u2019re born a specific ethnicity you can\u2019t change it.\n\nLiberals say this is racist but i don\u2019t see how that\u2019s the case, i am **not** in **any way** saying a person should be treated a certain way based on their ethnicity, but to pretend that ethnicity is entirely cultural and that ancestry has no role in defining it just isn\u2019t true.","1":"Unless you are willing to do that for every opinion and every group, you should not do it.\n\nFor one you act like one ethnicity and all the genders are some homogenous group. That frankly is just gross. For example, suppose I said I was against gun restrictions and you said \"oh look another alpha man\" this is bad for all genders. It assumes that men are this homogeny of gun loving. It also assumes none men, usually women are this homogeny of anti gun.\n\nPlus mentioning peoples gender is not a counter to any argument. \n\nif its not OK to assume someone is black because they made, say an opinion you don't like, you shouldnt do it assuming someone is white either. Suppose I said \"you have a dumb opinion, you must be black\" that of course is not OK. Neither is it OK to say \"I assume you are white because of your opinion I disagree with\" this assumes only white people can be in the group you disagree with. \n\nFurther more, this is hurtful to people who are not white. It assumes the groups that are not white are not diverse at all. \n\nAnd if people will say \"but statistically people who support trump identify as white\" then I can say, statistically people who do x are black. \n\nEither are standards are the same for all or we rid it for all.","2":"I think the strongest criticism comes from people who have never actually watched the show. Many critics will watch small clips of Carlson that are out of context and are fooled into believing he\u2019s saying something ridiculous. Furthermore, he does a great job of covering controversial subjects by stating facts that people don\u2019t want to hear, but still need to know in order to understand an issue. He really shined in mid 2020 when he provided great coverage and commentary of all the events taking place during that period.","3":"The left is calling for federal laws that enshrine the right to get elective abortions, while some people on the right are calling for federal laws that restrict abortion or outlaw it in all cases.\n\nHere are my thoughts on the type of federal abortion legislation we need: Enshrine the right to get an abortion if the pregnancy is the result of a rape, incest, or the fetus has a serious deformity, or if the life\/health of the mother is in danger if she delivers the baby -- but simultaneously outlaw any abortions that happen after viability.\n\nViability is the point where if the baby was extracted from the womb prematurely, it would still live and likely have a normal life. Once the baby reaches that point, it is a human, and aborting it is murder, plain and simple. Before viability is more of a grey area, so this legislation would allow the states to come up with their own laws, and the local populations could decide what type of restrictions they are going to have on abortions -- however, these states wouldn't be allowed to completely outlaw abortion in the case of a rape, incest, etc. as I listed above.\n\nI think this is a fair compromise, it gives states a lot of freedom to decide how they want abortion laws to be, which ultimately gives power back to the local population. This legislation also restricts the morally reprehensible parts of both sides though, such as killing babies after viability, or forcing women who were raped to deliver the baby.","4":"As a stripper, I have had to explain feminine nature to countless virgins or uneducated males who have zero clue how to please a woman sexually or romantically. I feel like a sex-ed teacher half the time to younger men. People villainize the industry on reddit and youtube saying how lonely most of the men are, but many of the lonely men learn through escorts, chaturbate streamers, female twitch streamers, and onlyfans girls about females and romance. People come to me for advice all the time about why they are unattractive, how to have sex, or how to get a girlfriend. In a way, I almost see it as a snowboarding instructor or another skilled instructor. Just because the activity is fun does not mean we should be demonized. Men are already lonely before they come to sex workers, so without us many of these men would have even less of a chance with normal girls due to their inexperience.","5":"I\u2019ve noticed that certain people on this sub tend to throw around that word for anything even slightly left-leaning. I\u2019ve also noticed radical SJW-types and wannabe revolutionaries labelling themselves communists because \u2018they support equality\u2019.\n\n\nMost people have no idea what the hammer and sickle actually represent.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what isn\u2019t communist:\n\n- taxes\n\n- universal healthcare & education\n\n- universal basic income\n\n- separation of church and state\n\n- democrats (including Sanders and AOC)\n\n- Europe\n\n- liberals\n\n- handouts to the unemployed\/lazy\n\n- environmental regulations\n\n- the anti-work movement\n\n- gun regulation\n\n- totalitarianism\n\nWhile certain communist philosophies do include a few of these, the mere presence of them does not make the concept or the society communist.\n\n\nOne particularly egregious one is UBI. The concept was initially developed by right-wing economists to help maintain income security so that people could keep spending and keep the market alive, but has come to be associated with communism, a philosophy that is so pro-labour it would despise UBI.","6":"on friday, roe v wade was overturned. like many people, i am absolutely livid about this fact. it is one of the most disgraceful moments in US history and america should be ashamed to have this moment in it\\`s history books. however, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. this is going to inspire liberals to take action against the evil that is the republican party. they are finally realizing that something must be done. a recent article has revealed that many more democrats are planning to vote after this overturning. another article also said that the republican party is afraid by how this will affect the future. and quite frankly, they should be afraid. because they have doomed themselves. while i\\`m sure that the republican party will someday take power again, after this overturning, it will probably be a while. i suspect that it will probably be years or even decades before we have another republican president. the american people have learned from their mistakes and are planning to do whatever they can to prevent history from repeating itself. congratulations republicans of america. you may have won the battle...but you are on the verge of losing the war.","7":"[removed]","8":"At the end of the day, its about whether abortion should be legal or illegal, at what point. That's it. Nothing else matters. because I notice a lot of people say they are pro life and that gets people to bring up stuff like foster care. If they don't want people to bring that up, they should not call themselves pro life. As someone who used to call myself pro life, I believe even if I wanted abortion illegal I wouldn't say it anymore because some people do not deserve life. I have no problem with capital punishment.\n\nOn the flip, though I support abortion being legal I find being pro choice of course isn't a good thing for everyone either. Some people might support a woman's right to choose an abortion, but not a criminals right to freedom to choose where to live (of course) \n\nIn my opinion 'pro choicers' also make dumb arguments. I also heard of people argue that criminals get their freedom removed because of violating the social contract. Then if abortion is illegal, no problem arresting people who try to get an abortion right?.\n\nI know you say they are unrelated. That's the point though. saying pro choice or pro life distracts from the main topic.","9":"So many people are convinced they are doing something by tweeting about, or flooding Reddit, with their political beliefs. You are not changing anything by promoting progressive ideals on social media. Straight up. In fact, I'd argue many people are harming the movement by spending all their time and energy on social media. Don't we realize that capitalist America would much rather have us online than in the streets protesting or putting progressive ideals into action by running for office? It's easy for politicians to ignore the angry Twitter mob, but it's a lot harder for them to ignore protesters outside their house or another political candidate challenging their beliefs.\n\nI'm convinced nobody has ever changed their political beliefs based off a tweet, or a reddit argument. I loathe the term, but when Reddit is flooded with political commentary without any action it just feels like disingenuous \"virtue signaling\".\n\nr\/antiwork is one of the biggest subreddits but what really is the point other than to complain? Believe me, I appreciate the sentiment but that sub is not going to reform anything. Sure, you could say it's \"raising awareness\" but what good has that actually caused? We saw what happened when that mod went on Fox News. He literally got laughed off the broadcast and completely dismissed.\n\nProgressives wonder why conservatives seem to be running the country despite the majority of the population being left leaning and it's because they'd rather talk down to republicans and repeat the same talking points than actually practice what they preach.\n\nWe need to realize that sharing your strong political beliefs on Reddit isn't any different than telling them to your dog. You aren't changing a damn thing and if you do want to make a change, log off and go put in the real effort. Until then, nothing in this country will change.","10":"DISCLAIMER: i do not in any way *encourage* anyone to do this, im simply stating that if i had the option between forced-birth and death, i\u2019d choose death.\n\ni\u2019ve always thought this, even as a 12 yr old girl. i don\u2019t think people realize how terrifying the thought of hosting another being in your body, constantly growing and stretching out your body to an unimaginably huge size and feeding off of you, then having to shit it out your vagina. it\u2019s like a parasite.\n\nsometimes it hurts to shit\u2026 my shit is nowhere near the size of a newborn yet i\u2019m supposed to squeeze that through my vagina? that sounds like someone just thought of the most fucked up torture method they could think of and that was what they got.\n\nimagine being a young girl or woman and hearing that there are people out there who *want* this to happen to you. sadistic freaks that are so angry at you for being a slut that they salivate at the thought of forcing you through one of the biggest fears we had as a child as a \u2018consequence\u2019. it sends shivers down my spine.\n\nwhen i was little, i always had the plan that if i were to get pregnant and couldn\u2019t get an abortion i\u2019d kill myself. that was literally the only option i could think of and it hasn\u2019t changed. it\u2019s either death or\u2026 that. i wanna cry. it isn\u2019t fair. i hate my body because of forced-birthers. i don\u2019t want to be in this body anymore it\u2019s too dangerous.","11":"I posted this in \/r\/offbeat and it got sufficiently downvoted that I'm convinced it's an unpopular opinion.\n\nNow, I do think it's bad that people lost access to abortions and that that was a negative thing that happened. BUT:\n\nPer [a recent article](https:\/\/www.insider.com\/gen-z-reconsiders-sex-wake-of-possible-post-roe-world-2022-6), Gen-Zers have stated that this ruling will \"deter [them] from casual sex\". \n\nBecause we know [from studies](https:\/\/royalsociety.org\/news\/2015\/01\/men-are-less-promiscuous-when-women-are-scarce\/) that more choice in sex partners leads to promiscuity, it follows that less choice leads to less promiscuity (or more monogamy\/abstinence). I believe this will overall lead to more stable relationships. Either that, or we will simply become more abstinent overall. But I'm banking on the former.\n\nBefore someone calls me a \"sexist, controlling asshole\" again, know that I didn't vote for this ruling, and also am not even an advocate for it. Again, I said it's a negative thing. What I am, however, is an observer making a prediction about the future. I am also an asshole though, so you got me there.","12":"What the fuck has happened to this country? Do I live in Afghanistan or the United States of fucking America?! Are we actually forcing women to stop having sex to avoid the risk of receiving a murder charge? What kind of fundamentalist logic is this? Abortions have always existed and will continue to exist until the end of time. Whether that means American women will have to start stabbing metal coat hangers into their vaginas like women in Haiti, or consume poison, you will not control the autonomy of another human being. Prepare yourselves for the spike in suicides and self-mutilations that are about to start in this country. Your self-righteous bullshit is going to ruin lives. Choosing the life of a non-sentient clump of cells over that of a fully developed human woman tells me this country has only regressed. \n\nAs a form of protest, as many women as possible should immediately refuse to engage in all hetero intercourse to intentionally cause the birthrate in this country to fall. Stop having children. A country that does not care about the livelihood of it\u2019s female citizens should have no future!\n\nIf you care about the welfare of American society, you will realize this is a terrible decision. You cannot force someone to go through with pregnancy. That is THEIR body. And please don\u2019t bother with the bullshit argument about personal responsibility. Women should be able to have as much sex as they want. Liberal attitudes towards sex is a defining feature of Western \u201cfreedom\u201d and culture. And if that happens to cause pregnancy, they should be freely able to access abortion pills or a sterile D&C. Taking this away will shift everything about our culture and submit women to unreasonable punishment. This goes against everything America stands for.","13":"Roe vs Wade guaranteed the right of abortion to all states. Literally the government telling you what to do. \n\nNow, it\u2019s up to the states to decide. \n\nAm I crazy, or is this the opposite of \u2018government mandating no abortions\u2019?\n\nPro-choice btw, so miss me with that.","14":"There used to be a time when putting on emojis on reddit was deeply frowned upon and people used to lash out at anyone who used a stupid smiley or cry emoji.  \n\nYet with the influx of edgy zoomers and teenagers and their incessant desire to spread this disease across every facet of medium in this world, there's not a single place in reddit where you won't see some dumb kid stringing dozens of emojis for no reason.  \n\nEmojis don't add anything to a discussion, they're just plain childish and demonstrate that you're too lazy to type.  \n\nI absolutely hate it and I know it's impossible to escape at this point.","15":"The right to same-sex and interracial marriage, the right to use birth control, the right to travel, the right to vote without poll taxes, the right to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty, the right to procreate.\n\nWhat do these rights have in common? None of these are explicitly mentioned in the US constitution, and have been established due to rulings of the Supreme Court. Yet, all of these rights are considered indispensable in any functioning democracy. Could you imagine states even being allowed to touch the right to procreate?\n\nHell, even the power of judicial review (the ability of the SC to declare a Legislative or Executive act in violation of the Constitution) is not in the text of the constitution; it was established in 1803 by the Supreme Court itself in the case of Marbury v. Madison (1803).\n\nMy point is that while there may or may not be other justifications for overturning Roe v Wade, the 'constitutional rights' argument is probably the worst one, since (a) the ninth amendment exists, and (b) if a right can be stripped based on the fact that it isn't in the constitution, it places all of the above rights in danger.","16":"People that were invoking \"my body my choice\" in discussions regarding mandatory covid vaccination, who are now happy for the overturning of Roe vs Wade, are hypocrites of the highest order.  Bodily autonomy should be preserved across the board regardless of your preferred line of reasoning.  I made a similar post a while ago condemning the opposite crowd (pro mandatory vax, pro roe vs wade) and now my disgust with all parties is equal.  I am pro-abortion\/choice, and against any kind of mandatory vaccination. If you disagree with this sentiment then I think you are a hypocrite.","17":"All the people in the pro choice crowd keep saying that abortion is banned when it's not. It's simply letting the states decide their own abortion laws. It's especially hilarious seeing people in strong blue states freak out over this when they won't be effected at all. There is no doubt in my mind that states in California and New York will keep abortion legal for all cases up until 9 months. Heck they might even allow for post birth if they can. Just a wild guess here but probably about half the states will allow abortion on demand up until the day the baby is outside the womb. \n\nSome states will probably ban late term abortions and a few more 2nd trimester abortions. The only states that honestly might abandon all elective abortions will probably be Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas but even those states will still allow for the life of the mother. Even people in the states with strict abortion laws are still going to be able to drive on over to the next state. So there you go all the states will allow for abortions if the mother's life is at risk and most will allow 1st trimester abortions and quite a few states will have it on demand anytime for any reason. So really most of the people who are pro choice already live in areas that will allow it anyways and the people who want to get an abortion will be able to do it anyways since most states will at least allow 1st trimester which is when almost all abortions happen anyways. I'm more on the pro life side but even if I was pro choice I wouldn't be freaking out.","18":"If you only surround yourself with people who share your views, you're basically creating an echo-chamber around yourself.

Debating people can be fun and is a good way to challenge and exercise your own intelligence.\n\nSaw a bunch of posts about people breaking up with their partners over abortion opinions and a whole thread of people saying to discuss politics on the first date and they just made me cringe.\n\nMinor Caveat Edit: If someone else's political stance literally revolves around them hating you for being black or gay or some shit or they make their opinions their entire personality then yeah obviously that relationships not gonna work out.

Hell, you aren\u2019t even trying. Get in the gym. Being fit and lean + muscular is the bare minimum to be attractive. You shouldn\u2019t even be talking to girls outside a platonic\/professional context if you\u2019re out of shape. Even being skinny is better than being fat.\n\nSeriously, fitness and physique is an extremely important aspect in dating or just getting laid. There\u2019s a reason why guys are always told to get in the gym when they complain about dating struggles. Looks, strength, and being healthy are so important for guys.\n\nSo yeah. Get fit before trying. Start lifting. Don\u2019t just lose weight; get your body fat down to around 10% while building muscle.

As seen in the whole verse about a camel entering the eye of a needle being easier than a rich dude entering heaven for example. It reads almost like a person who never worked a day in their lives seeing some random rich guy walking down the street and then writing in their diary about how much they hate that they don't get enough welfare and  handouts and how that rich dude *must* be the evil one. It's so blatantly collectivistic and anti-individual that I find it hilarious how so-called 'rugged individualist' conservatives who claim to support unrestricted laissez-faire capitalism will proceed to talk about Jesus and recite cherry-picked verses.\n\nIt looks to me almost like a reversal of the worldview and systems prior to Christianity:organized religion turned things upside down by declaring the strong and successful 'evil' while declaring the weak and submissive 'good'. This is literally just modern socialism's disdain for people who are successful and live for themselves rather than giving out free stuff,but with a bit of mysticism mixed in. \n\nLook at the 'seven deadly sins':greed,pride,sloth,envy,wrath,lust,gluttony. To me personally,this looks like a way of guilt-tripping people for having an animalistic side because,after all,humans are still an animal. Why? Because all of these 'sins' are completely natural:not only that,but they are even *useful*. \n\nYou can use greed as a motivation to succeed. Pride the same. Envy the same. Wrath you would use to take revenge on your enemies. Lust (for success) drives you to become the most ambitious you can be. Gluttony and sloth? This can just be interpreted as indulging in and enjoying the results of your success.\n\nReligion is anti-nature,anti-individual and anti-logic. It is based on emotional manipulation and 'faith' in unproven concepts based on superstition. Any *true* conservative who genuinely believes in a society based on individualism first and foremost and has as his life motto 'DON'T TREAD ON ME' will reject religion altogether and base his beliefs purely on reason. Evangelical 'conservatives' are just totalitarian pseudocommunists attempting to control people and take away everyone's right to autonomy.\n\n\nAll authoritarianism is based on destroying people's autonomy through herd mentality and forced conformity:Religious zealots? \"Your property belongs to God,not you!\" Communists? \"Your property belongs to everyone,not just you!\" Fascism? \"Your property belongs to the nation,not you!\" . The first basis for establishing a state based on force and coercion like this is emotional manipulation. All conservatives who promote religion are merely socialists in disguise,refusing to acknowledge and denying that their religious book is one based on doctrines that sanctify and glorify submissiveness and weakness while demonizing ambition and success. Any conservative who has any level of actual self-respect and self-awareness should be an atheist if they genuinely believe in putting the individual above the collective as they like to claim they do.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED-Talk.","27":"Then everyone can be happy and all this intense political fighting and deep polarization can finally end. This is how I would implement it:\n\n* first, democrats and republicans should fork the constitution and propose changes to it as they see fit (e.g. the democrat constitution guarantees abortion and gay rights, the republican constitution more explicitly and expansively guarantees speech and gun laws).\n\n* then, the residents of each state votes to choose which constitution they would like to adopt. the side with >50% of the votes wins for each state.\n\n* each state becomes a state in one of the two new countries\n\n* once the voting is done, all people will be given a two-year time period where they can move to a state which will be in the country of their choice, if they are not in it already. once the two-year period is up, they will become a citizen of the country where there state is in.\n\n* we will have european style freedom of movement between the two new countries enshrined in the constitution of both countries. but one side can do border checks if they like (e.g. to prevent illegal immigration).\n\n* we should also have a robust free trade agreement enshrined in the constitution of both countries.\n\n* lastly, to start with, both countries will inherit the current statutes and common law, then each countries legislature can repeal or modify as they see fit.","28":"I am a neolibertarian (something in between a neocon and a libertarian). Naturally I hate all populists, like Donald Trump. I never liked his political positions. However, after the recent supreme court decision to overturn Roe v.

If we had a weak republican (e.g. Jeb Bush), we probably wouldn't have been able to get a third justice in there. Or he probably would have capitulated to the Democrats and nominated Merrick Garland. But not Trump! He steamrolled the Democrats and man handled them. For that we finally take a step towards stopping the genocide against unborn children.","29":"Keep in mind that my argument is being made assuming that you are anti-abortion but you don't hold your belief because of religious conviction, or at least not entirely due to that. \n\n**IF** you are anti-abortion, or 'pro-life' then you believe it is the duty of someone who is pregnant to bring to term their baby. In other words, you believe that the baby's life takes precedence over the bodily autonomy of the pregnant individual. \n\n**THEN** you must also support a policy of mandatory organ donation in any case where it is viable. This would include people who are adamantly against having their own organs removed post-mortem, so long as they remain in tact afterwards, just as anti-abortion policy forces those who would prefer to have an abortion to bring their baby to term.\n\nOrgan donation is a life-saving medical procedure that takes organic material from one body, and gives it to another, who would not be able to keep living without it. This is the same as abortion, from the point of view of someone who is 'pro-life'","30":"If you call yourself pro-life, but think exemptions should be made in stances of rape, you're full of shit.\n\nIf protecting the fetus is relevant because it is seen to have some inherent value, that inherent value is not reduced because of how it came to be. It will still develop, in time, into a human being provided it doesn't miscarry like 10-15% of most pregnancies. \n\nHowever, if seen as a moral punishment of a woman for her misdeeds, this exception makes perfect sense. A woman who willingly had sex must be forced to carry a child to term as a method of control or punishment by society, unless it really isn't her fault that the sex occurred. This is much more consistent with the rape\/incest exceptions. \n\nI'm willing to accept that this is about societal control over women rather than punishment, and I won't take that as a change in my view though I'm still interested in discussion. \n\nAnd primarily I'm interested to see if there's any rational for that exception to an abortion ban that leaves the ban with an internally consistent philosophy that isn't about punishing or controlling women.","31":"I\u2019m pro-life but abortions should be safe, legal and rare. For far to long congress has avoided regulating this issue. Democrats had 50 years to ensure abortion safeguards and continuously avoided doing so even though they campaigned on it. Because of this the abortion industry and progressives pushed murder for profit. I will never encourage ending a healthy pregnancy but some instances it is medically necessary. The youngest viable baby was born at 21 weeks. Anything after that both lives should be taken into consideration.\n\nNow that the Supreme Court has righted this historical wrong that allowed killing of healthy babies for profit. Democrats are finally going to have to fulfill their promises. They will have to legislate safeguards to preserve life and abortions because it is necessary.","32":"The overwhelming majority of people pro-choice or pro-abortion are also pushing socialized health care systems.

Here are the basic definitions:\n\n**Deontology:** right and wrong are determined by set absolute immutable moral 'laws' or rules. Actions which abide by these moral rules are regarded as more ethical than actions which break these moral rules.\n\n**Utilitarianism:** right and wrong are determined by their consequences; it can basically be summed up as \"the greatest good for the greatest majority\". Basically, actions which increase net happiness and well-being are regarded as more ethical than actions which reduce net happiness and well-being.\n\nBased on these definitions, I think it is fair to say that left-wingers are utilitarian, while right-wingers are deontological. Right-wingers are more likely to stick to certain rules like less taxes or the free market, even if circumventing those concepts could lead to greater net happiness. Left-wingers are more likely to evaluate the action by their consequence on the net well-being of people, even if these actions run directly against concepts like right to life. What does this mean in practice? I'll try to illustrate it using abortion rights as an example:\n\n**Right-wing:** Moral rule: taking an innocent life is wrong. Life begins at conception. Ergo, abortions should be largely restricted.\n\n**Left-wing:** People will get abortions regardless of restrictions. They should be able to get those in safe medical settings even if it kills the foetus. Reducing abortion restriction saves more lives, which increases net happiness. Ergo, abortions should be largely unrestricted.\n\nThis is just something I've noticed frequently in my interactions, I'd love to hear other views on this.","38":"A fetus is quite literally a developing human. \n\nPeople go into semantics about when a fetus qualifies as a human, but to me, the question is less about what it is now, than how it is developing &amp;amp; what it becomes.\n\nIf a fetus is developing normally, then for all intents and purposes, it will eventually become a human. Ergo, to abort before it can finish it\u2019s development, is essentially murdering a human before they\u2019re born.\n\n**Every** multicellular organism is a \u201ccluster of cells\u201d.

I would rather people just not have sex, or if they do to use proper protection, but I know better.

Therefore, I propose that from now on we justify any and all abortions for whatever reason a woman chooses in the following way:\n\n\"Go fuck yourself. That's why\"\n\nAbortion is a medical issue between a woman and her doctor. That's all. \n\nThe pro life position is a bunch of superstitious nonsense combined with a grossly misplaced sense of importance of humanity to the ecosystem.

You're not going to help raise a total strangers kid, so you get no say at all.

We are the most populous and have the largest economy of all the states, but the majority of the nation hates us due to being such a far-left, \"deep blue\" state. Even the other \"blue\" states don't think very highly of us. We are so far-left that a lot of the so-called \"liberals\", in their quest to make the world a more tolerant place, are doing the exact opposite. They will attempt to cancel somebody simply for having a different political leaning without taking time to understand why they feel the way they do about various things. I have plenty of friends whose political views are different from mine, but the reason why I am friends with them is because they aren't assholes about it.\n\nFor the record, I hate extremism as a whole, no matter if its from the right or the left.

It is set in a world where western nations are fighting with utopian terrorists over the world's most valuable resources -- in other words, it is set in a world a lot like ours.  In fact I'd guess that there are people who played Command and Conquer in the 90s as teenagers and by the early 00s were driving tanks across oil Iraqi oil fields taking out [technicals](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technical_\\(vehicle\\)).\n\nThe strategic loop in Command and Conquer is as simple as it gets - you need resources to build military units, and you need military units to control resources.  Which means that when you see your opponents collecting resources, it's only a matter of time before there's going to be a bunch of tanks and troops headed your way.\n\nAnd that's a great lesson, because in the real world, when countries build militarizes and invade resource-rich areas, like the US invading Iraq and Russia invading Ukraine, most of the debate is about how the war started, whether it was justified, what the goals are, etc.  Nobody really wants to admit that the point of having a large military isn't to just have it sit on the sidelines, its to acquire and defend resources, and yet the conflicts generally play out exactly that way, with troops being sent to poorly defended and resource-rich areas.\n\nA related lesson is that when you give or cede resources to hostile actors, they're almost guaranteed to be used against you at some point.  Europe never countered Russian aggression in Crimea or Georgia and continued to buy energy from them, and yet was somehow surprised when they invaded the Ukraine. Likewise, after the Iranian revolution, people were surprised that the new regime immediately launched an attack on Iraq..  And just this year the Taliban have just been given control of a country and billions of dollars in weapons, and in about a year everyone will be surprised when they attack one of their neighbors or even our allies.  Instead of being surprised all the time, we should heed the lessons of C&C and be prepared.\n\nAnother important lesson from Command and Conquer is that you always need to be able to understand the conflict from the perspective of your opponent .  That's because if you want to stop a Hitler, Stalin, Bin Laden, or Putin, the very first thing you need to do is to think like them.  And there is absolutely nothing unpatriotic or wrong about having that discussion even though some people try to tell you differently.  (That you're supporting Putin or the terrorists or whatever by acknowledging that they have goals and motivations.)\n\nIn Command and Conquer it is also pretty easy to send a few flame tanks or engineers to blow up an opponents harvester or a grab a building or two and sell them, but ultimately you can't win the game that way, it just a delaying tactic at best.  Terrorism in the real world is very similar - it results in loss of life and makes headlines, but really doesn't change the power dynamic because ultimately it just consuming resources.  This explains why after the 9\/11 attacks, terrorists shifted their focus from attacks in developed countries to attacks in weaker countries in which governments could be established, for example Syria, Yemen, and attacking the weak government in Iraq, and also why the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had little lasting impact.\n\nSchools have been making headlines lately, and not in a good way - teaching kindergartners about gender identity or teenagers how privileged or oppressed they are.  Incorporating Command and Conquer into the curriculum would be a useful educational tool for understanding geopolitics and developing new strategies and tactics in the war on terror.  It would also motivate students to learn how to build the advanced technologies available in the game, such as the Ion cannon, tesla coil, mammoth tank, and the mobile construction vehicle.  Used properly, it could grab the attention of today's apathetic students and create a new generation of leaders ready and willing to defend civilization if it deserves to be defended, or else overthrow it if it becomes too corrupt and authoritarian, both noble goals  that seem to have been lost by the preceding generations..","54":"[removed]","55":"Its unpopular to be able to agree with both sides now. \nOf course there is more nuance, but people shit on the anti socialists when they have legit concerns. and vice versa.

Electoral   College. There needs to be 101 electoral votes. How many electoral   votes does your state\/territory get? That depends on the population.   Example: California has a population of 39.35m people and America has   329.5m people. California has 12% of the population, so they get 12   electoral votes. All states and territories add up to 101 so they're all   represented and there can be no ties. The amount each state gets is   based on the most recently complete census at the time.\n2. Voter ID. You gotta prove you're an American citizen to vote in an American election. There is nothing racist about it.\n3. Polls.   Polls need to close at 8, and there needs to be universal standards as   to when the cutoff is. I know in Philadelphia, if you're waiting in  line  when polls close, you still get to vote. That makes the votes in  that  are vulnerable to manipulation. It should be polls close 8PM with  or  without you. If you care about the election, you'll find a way to  get  there.\n4. Mail-ins.   None of this crap with \"finding\" ballots 3 days after election day.   Only ballots that are received by the voting committee by election day   should count, and they must be signed and you must provide your license   information.\n5. Long   lines. I hear all the time how in poor areas, there are long lines.   That's why there will be a 2 minute limit. You should know who you're   voting for anyway. After 2 minutes, the ballot machines will cut off and   whatever choices you've selected will be submitted\n6. Ballot   machines. I know in some jurisdictions, elections are still run by   paper ballots. The universal norm should be machines in all states and   all counties. Russia can't hack these machines, that's an egregious lie.","76":"Its funny how people say they should help Ukraine but then bitch when they helped in Afghanistan. \n\nPeople talk about 'bombing Afghanistan'.. like what do you think?

Evolutionarily, Cats did not gain an upper hand in hunting. Most hunts result in failure, regardless of Species. Cats lack endurance, and are not as widely distributed as Dogs. Studies have proven time and time again that the most successful, effective Predator in Africa is the African Wild Dog. When you look at where wild Cats and wild Dogs live, both today and throughout history, you notice one key thing. Dogs have made it to every major landmass. Cats have made it to every major landmass, except Australia, which has no wild Cats. No I'm not counting domestic Cats that are feral, I'm talking wild Cat Species. The most feared Animal in India, when it comes to other Animals fearing them, is the Dhole, India's Wild Dog, and even Tigers are afraid of them. Dholes have been said to attack and kill Tigers as well. Dholes terrorize the entire Indian forest, and as a pack, they are as deadly as they come. This isn't to say Cats aren't good Predators, they are, but they are not the Ultimate Predators in the world.","80":"This legitimately makes no sense at all.

It would be impossible to please everybody.\n\nAlso, every living organism in the history (and prehistory) of living things is hardwired in their nature to make decisions that chiefly benefit the decision-maker.\n\nJust becuase it benefits yourself at someone else's **inconvenience** does not make it selfish. It's when it benefits yourself at someone else's **expense.**\n\nExample: Selfish is a greedy business owner who lays off employees so he could save enough for his vacation home. He made a decision that benefited himself (saving money) at the **expense** of other people (they lost their jobs).\n\nSelfish is NOT taking the last pack of cosmic brownies at ShopRite. It benefitted yourself (you got the brownies) but it was at someone else's **inconvenience** (they simply didn't get the brownies).\n\nI've also been hearing a lot of people use that word during the pandemic. I'm not selfish for wanting to go to a baseball game or going to see my friends or going out to a bar. \n\nHowever, YOU are selfish for wanting me to stay home and for all the businesses to shut down.

If this is not aiding and abetting computer hacking, then what is? As a software developer, I can 100% vouch and say this is aiding and abetting computer hacking at the very least. Also, no real journalist provides their sources with hacking tools.\n\nSecond, Julian Assange clearly hates the United States and want to hurt the United States - he has an agenda.

Don't get me wrong, there are places in this country where women really shouldn't walk alone at night, but that's usually where even men aren't completely safe at night. Ya know in CRIME prone areas. But this absurd message has spread like wildfire to women BY women and weak leftist men that the mysterious nature of nighttime somehow completely revokes their ability to walk alone at night. Maybe it annoys me so much because I would never commit a crime against another person regardless of gender. But the way these women speak about \"not going out at night\" it's like they think stepping outside at night will cause a criminal to spawn next to you like in a video game and start assaulting you. It's a mostly absurd message and it's purposefully an oppressive message to say that women aren't allowed to walk alone at night because they won't be safe.","94":"She was a field correspondent in a war zone. What do you think happens in a war zone? Do you think its puppies and flowers? No, of course not. It's bullets, mortars, and bombs. It's death and maiming. Anyone who suggests the Israelis intentionally killed her is a brainwashed anti-semite. She was killed accidently or as collateral damage, which is a very real risk for anyone in any war zone. She knew this was a possibility when going to a war zone. So if you are to blame anyone, blame the war.\n\nNow, why does this war exist? It exists because Palestinians and Arabs in the Middle East are ethno-nationalists who believe non-Muslims living in the Middle East should be killed - kind of like a Blood-and-Soil type thing. They want Israel wiped off the face of the Earth and have said so many times. This is why they hate Israel, even though Israel has offered three times for Palestinians to become Israeli, the only nation in the Middle East with freedom and a GDP per capita higher than the United Kingdom.","95":"When Americans and people in the West think of Greece, they tend to group it with other Southern European nations at its latitude: Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Some people even reach further and group it with Turkey, Armenia, and the countries to its east.\n\nBoth of these are inaccurate. The countries that Greece is actually most similar to are Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania, Romania, and Serbia, aka the rest of the Balkans. \n\nGreek food, music, folk culture, architecture, and religion are shared with the nations to their immediate north, and while you can find similarities to other Southern European or even to some Near Eastern nations, you can find the same in other Balkan nations also. Any similarity you find between Greece and Turkey\/Armenia can also be found with Bulgaria and Albania, whereas the reverse is not true.\n\nNot all of Greece is Mykonos and Santorini. If you went to Thessaloniki or to Ioannina, you would be very surprised. These cities do not feel Southern European or Mediterranean, they feel Balkan. You will not see whitewashed buildings and feel the warmth of the Mediterranean sun... you will feel no different than if you were in Bulgaria or Serbia.\n\nPeople focus on the influence Greece had on Rome and on the Near East, but what about the influence it had on Eastern Europe? The Cyrillic alphabet originated within the borders of modern day Greece, and was based on the Greek alphabet. The Eastern Orthodox faith spread to the Slavic world from Greece. What exactly in modern day Egypt or Syria, two predominantly culturally conservative Islamic nations which consider themselves full fledged members of the Arab world, is reminiscent of Greece?

They haven't been cool for years.

Not having a tattoo is the new having a tattoo. You think you're so unique by having a tattoo. In the UK 1 in 3 young adults has a tattoo. Yeah you're so unique just like everyone else. Having a tattoo is like wearing the same uniform everyday. So unique.\n\nTattoo parlors are littered with pre-drawn designs so what most people get doesn't even have an ounce of originality to begin with, permanently scaring yourself to stand out from the crowd by adding yourself to a large pool of people with identical tattoos to yourself. The irony of branding yourself like the rest of the cattle then claiming to be unique. Lets face it, tattoos are for stupid people.\n\nAs Theodore Dalrymple writes ''There are many things that I don't understand, for example why intelligent people would want a tattoo''. One of MTV's finest excrement's is a show called \"Just tattoo of us\". Hosted by Charlotte Crosby, a woman famous for having sex on tv and getting her vagina out at every available opportunity and Steven Bear, a man so devoid of intelligence that MRI scans would have trouble picking up brain wave activity. The premise of the show is that people get tattoos designed by their friends with no input of their own. This leads to some permanent passive aggressive tats. Such as one girl got slut tattooed on her 19 year old cousin because she slept with 4 of her boyfriend's friends. Again tattoos are for stupid people. A highlight of the show is when Charlotte Crosby gets a tattoo of a half bear\/half cheetah on her back from Steven Bear as a reminder that she cheated on her ex boyfriend with him. She then proceeds to try to assault him.It's like watching prehistoric homo-genus discover tattoo guns instead of fire. Again tattoos are for stupid people.\n\nWith most relationships now lasting shorter than a goldfish's attention span, tattoo regret is now a growing problem. So many people regret getting shoddily done work that there is now an entire TV show dedicated to covering up bad tattoos. The tattoo industry constantly complains about this show because in many cases the awfully designed cover ups are even more embarrassing the the originals. Hiding bad tattoos with more bad tattoos.

Therefore the climate is not 'real' (and it cannot be), it is only a (statistical) model of reality.","100":"[deleted]","101":"I have always been pro-choice on the basis that I feel it is wrong to force a woman to continue to be pregnant against her will, intuitively it just feels wrong. I still consider myself \"pro-choice\" even know. But when I am forced to reckon with abortion by actually analyzing pro-choice arguments and their implications, I find it increasingly difficult to defend them (except for cases of rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother) and now feel morally conflicted.\n\n**The \"it is women making choices about their own body\" argument:**\n\nA woman choosing to have an abortion is not just choosing something for her own body, but also for someone else's body: that of the fetus. Fetuses are not part of the women's body even before viability because they are a separate entity with a separate DNA profile, and are just as much a biological product of the father as the mother. \n\nA woman is technically choosing what to do with her own body, yes, in that she is choosing to no longer be pregnant if she does not want to be, but she is also choosing to end the life of another entity which is not part of her physical body. The fetus draws nutrients from the mother's body to develop and grow, but that doesn't make it part of her body. To argue that it is, is factually incorrect.\n\n**The \"a fetus is a parasite and thus it is acceptable to kill it\" argument:**\n\nA parasite is defined as an organism of one species that attaches itself to an organism of ***another species,*** with the intent of extracting resources for its own survival at the expense of the host. By definition, a fetus is not a parasite. The fetus did not \"attach itself\" to the mother, the fetus is present because the mother and the father engaged in sexual intercourse, for which the known outcome is pregnancy. To describe the fetus as a \"parasite\" akin to a tapeworm is to dehumanize it with the intent of justifying its death by implying it is less than human and an invasive species, and using this sort of language to describe humans of any stage of development is inhumane.\n\n**The \"fetuses are less developed and therefore less valuable than their mother\" argument:**\n\nThis is probably the most persuasive pro-abortion argument, but it has deeply eugenicist undertones.  Note that I said above that a woman should be prioritized over her fetus if the pregnancy is going to kill her, but this is not based on me assigning more moral value to the woman over the fetus, it is that if the mother dies, the vast majority of the time so will the fetus, whereas the reverse is not true, so saving the mother saves one life, while trying to save the fetus is more likely to result in two deaths.\n\nAny time we try to assess the worth and value of another person's life, of any stage of development, based on their characteristics or stage of development, we open the door to eugenics. If we try to imply a fetus is less worthy of life and thus can be killed because it is \"less developed\" or \"dependent on its mother\" then we no longer can clearly articulate why we cannot kill people who society deems as \"parasites\" or \"lesser than\": people who depend on machines for survival in the hospital, people who are disabled and do not provide any economic benefit to society and extract more resources from society than they contribute, the impoverished, people on welfare, people who are unintelligent, and so on. When you define the value of life in terms of development or ability to contribute to society, it has dangerous implications. There is a reason many people say they support abortion \"if the child will have Down syndrome\" or have a \"disability.\" \n\nWe do not have the right to decide which lives are more valuable than others and then suggest that those which are less valuable can be killed. \n\n**The \"banning abortion forces women to obtain illegal abortions\/women have no choice\/contraception is inaccessible\" argument:**\n\nNearly every single person on the face of this planet knows that having unprotected sex will result in pregnancy. I knew this when I was 10 years old. Even in schools where abstinence-only sex education is taught, people know that sex results in pregnancy. That a grown woman of sound mind would not know this is just something I refuse to believe. \n\nYes, there are instances where birth control or contraception can be sabotaged by a controlling partner, or birth control can fail, and this is one of the reasons that I continue to acknowledge that there will always be exceptions in which abortion should be accessible, but the argument that banning abortion forces women to have unsafe abortions in the majority of instances is to imply that women generally have NO control over whether they become pregnant which is blatantly false. This isn't a moral dilemma but a falsehood. \n\nThe argument that contraception is inaccessible is also false. Obtaining free or highly affordable condoms is not difficult. Birth control is usually covered by insurance. if a man and woman choose to not use these protective measures because \"condoms make sex less pleasurable\" or \"birth control throws off my body\" then you are making an active choice to risk a pregnancy occurring, and it is your fault if it does. Take responsibility for your outcomes. \n\n**The \"abortion is a women's rights issue\/racial justice issue, men can just walk away from parenthood and removing abortion makes the situation inequitable for women\" argument:**\n\nThere are many reasons why this is just false.\n\n1. Women can give their child up for adoption and are not forced to be a parent against their will. To state that removing abortion makes women forced to be mothers is just not true. \n2. Men cannot just legally walk away from parenthood if the woman chooses to give birth and raise the child. Men see their wages garnished, driver's licenses revoked or points put on their license akin to if they got into an at-fault accident, or can be sent to jail for refusing to pay child support. A woman can choose to absolve herself of all of this by having an abortion, but men do not have the same ability, so not only is a woman making a choice about someone else's body (the fetus) but the man's entire life trajectory. And before you say \"well maybe the man should not have stuck it in, he had his choice when he refused to have unprotected sex,\" so did the woman. Abortion doesn't give women equal rights, it gives them special privileges over at least two other people's lives.\n3. Abortion clinics have been disproportionately placed in low-income areas inhabited primarily by people of color, especially Black people. Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, is on record stating that the goal of Planned Parenthood was to eliminate the Black population by reducing its birth rates. Abortion has led to far more Black deaths than police brutality, slavery, and genocides combined. Abortion is a wealthy white woman's issue, and has harmed the Black community irreparably, and is the reason why despite the Black population having higher number of children per household, the Black population has remained stagnant at roughly 12-13% for decades. Abortion is racist.\n\n**The \"abortion enables women to have fulfilling sex lives on their own terms\" argument:** \n\nThis will make me sound like a 70 year old Christian conservative, but I do not feel that a culture that encourages promiscuity, depravity, and decadence is a good thing. Going home with strangers you met at a club or bar every weekend and having unprotected sex creates public health risks, including sexually transmitted infections, mental health issues, and is dangerous. You never know who you are going home with and what that person is capable of, and while it is not your fault if you are murdered or raped, a dangerous situation could occur that could be prevented if we did not live in a culture of hedonism. \n\nAbortion enables people to believe that they can make risky choices with no consequences, because there is always a way out. There IS NOT always a way out of every dangerous situation that can occur if you hook up indiscriminately with strangers. \n\nThe other part of this, is that the notion that women are all pro-choice and men are all pro-life is false. Most pro-life charities and organizations are run by women, and there are many, MANY instances where men try to force the woman into having an abortion she does not want to have because he does not want to be a father. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Abortion cannot be easily defended when you go through each pro-choice argument one by one and I am now forced to reconsider my stance.","102":"If you ask me, it just teaches girls to be complacent in their role and not question their place.

My point is different. indexes are inherently flawed because they cannot account for different situations that exist in every country.\n\nI got into a discussion recently with someone who tried to use these said indexes to compare the US to Norway: a country that frequently ends up at the tops of these lists, along with the other Scandinavian countries. Two of the arguments this user brought up were \u201cgovernment represents people better in Norway than the US\u201d and \u201cNorway currently doesn\u2019t have the racial issues the US does\u201d. And in said index, points got taken off for the US in such.\n\nI won\u2019t deny that Norway has fewer racial issues, and probably has government that represents its people better than the US, HOWEVER, it\u2019s important to note that Norway is a country with not even 6 million people, and a 93% white population (83.2% of the population being native Norwegians), while the US has over 330 million people, and is far, far racially diverse in its racial makeup, and culturally.\n\nSo yeah, no shit Norway is going to have far fewer racial issues or better representation. Because they don\u2019t have to represent nearly as broadly, nor do they have as nearly as size able racial minority population. \n\nA country like (but not limited to) the US will, not by any fault of its own, be taken points off for this. And that\u2019s just scratching the surface. \n\nMy point is that these indexes try their best to apply parameters to ALL countries like a monolith, something you simply cannot do fairly and justly.","104":"[deleted]","105":"There are really three statements about Kyle people are claiming are defamatory.\n\n1. \"Kyle is a murderer\" \n\nLet's establish something right off the bat. A statement of opinion is not defamatory, nor is a statement that's an evaluation of publicly available fact. So when people say \"Kyle is a murderer\", what are they saying? They're saying that what Kyle did that night in Kenosha fits the definition of murder. They can be referring to the legal definition or some other definition and it's still not defamatory. Just because he was found not guilty doesn't mean he's not a murderer and doesn't mean that you can't call him a murderer. Being found not guilty just means that the government failed to prove he committed the act beyond a reasonable doubt. That failure doesn't constrain anyone's free speech. That's why we can all call OJ Simpson a murderer despite his acquittal and why PETA can call all meat eaters murderers even though that's not the legal definition of murder.\n\n2. \"Kyle is a white supremacist\"\n\nThis is a statement about Kyle's state of mind, his thoughts and beliefs. It's impossible to prove what he thinks or believes, and so any statements about state of mind are really just opinions. People have different definitions of what a white supremacist is, and they have different beliefs about what they think Kyle thinks. It's not defamatory to use a different definition and to state your beliefs.\n\n3. \"Kyle crossed state lines with a gun\" or other specific factual claims\n\nThis is the category of claims that might actually qualify as defamatory because they are actual factual statements. The problem is, Kyle is at least a limited purpose public figure. This means that for statements to be defamatory, they have to be made with actual malice, meaning they have to be statements known to be false or known with high probability to be false. So you'd need to prove anyone repeating this claim knew it was false at the time. That's hard to prove, especially since so many people were saying it. \"I heard this other outlet say it and I thought it was true\" would be a reasonable defense against a defamation suit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRittenhouse just wants fame and quick money. Fighting a lawsuit in court is expensive, so media orgs that know they'd win in court will still settle if they know it's still saving money overall. So Rittenhouse will collect his checks for small undisclosed amounts and everyone will pretend he won big and he'll be famous a little longer.","106":"\"r\/TrueUnpopularOpinion aims to be a space for the discussion of unpopular opinions, free of some of the censorship found on many other subreddits.\" [reference](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/4rbiu9bf17691.jpg)","107":"For weeks now, the left and Democrats have been waging an insurrection against the Supreme Court, storming their personal homes, engaging in violence and, now, we see just the other day there was an assassination attempt against Justice Kavanaugh. This attack on this nation's democracy and overt intimidation of Supreme Court justices will only end when these rioters have followed through in their goal of assassinating one of the judges. What's even more startling is that it would seem that the leadership of the Democratic party are more than happy to facilitate this happening, as they appear to be doing very little to stop this madness and unrest, even after the assassination attempt. You can be sure if it was conservative individuals outside the homes of Justices Sotomayor or Kagel and there was an assassination attempt, the Democratic party would be sending in the National Guard to clean up the situation... however, when it is their own ideological partners at the heart of the action, they are MORE than happy to just turn a blind eye, even at the prospect of a conservative Supreme Court justice getting assassinated.","108":"Ethan used to have, and secretly still has, reasonable political views.

Around then his clothing brand, Teddy Fresh, started to blow up. However, the main buyers were not the H3H3 demographic but rather females aged 15-30. This is the point when he started to become a multi-millionaire and the gears started to turn in his brain. He realized the more he catered and appealed to this demographic the more money he would make. From 2018-2020 he completely transformed his content and political views to appeal to young females. Quite frankly, he has done this very successfully.

I am not joking. I think that if he did so, it would totally change the political landscape for the better. This is going to be a bit long but, if you stick with me for the next few paragraphs, I will explain why I believe this. \n\n**1.** **The Democrats have an education problem:**\n\nWhy don\u2019t the Democrats dominate American politics? Why was the last election, which took place during the biggest pandemic in a century, so close? How the hell did the Democrats lose to Trump in 2016? Why do they [seem set to lose again](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/2021\/11\/16\/democrats-are-course-lose-2022-2024-if-they-do-we-may-lose-our-democracy\/)? \n\nThere are a bunch of theories, but I believe it is because the Democrats have become overly focused on college educated voters. I\u2019m not the first one to point this out. This classic article appeared in [*Vox* in 2016](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2016\/4\/21\/11451378\/smug-american-liberalism) and here\u2019s one that came out in *The New York Times* [last month](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/10\/08\/opinion\/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html) and another one from this month in [the same publication](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/11\/04\/opinion\/democrats-culture-wars.html). If you don\u2019t want to read all that, I can sum it up for you, the Democrats\u2019 style and rhetoric is geared toward people who have at least a four-year degree. \n\nBut here\u2019s the problem[, most Americans do not](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States#\/media\/File:Map_of_states_percentage_of_population_with_Bachelor's_Degree_or_Higher_in_2009.svg). And this is increasingly creating a class divide in the country where two-thirds of voters feel like they are being talked down to and scolded by a party that wants their votes. This is an insane way to try to win elections and it needs to stop. \n\nI have news for Democrats, they can take the support of college educated voters for granted. As long as the Republicans continue their decent into increasingly insane ideologies such as, climate change denial, anti-vaxxing and even Qanon, you can be sure that the educated class will not vote Republican. So, the task at hand is to get the votes of people without college degrees. \n\n**2.** **Enter Snoop Dogg:**\n\nSnoop would be the perfect vessel to usher in an era of progressive dominance in the United States. To start with nearly everyone knows who he is. The median age [for American voters in early 40s](https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/policy\/docs\/ssb\/v64n2\/v64n2p57.pdf), which means that the average voter was in high school when Dr. Dre released *The Chronic* and propelled Snoop to superstardom. He is an incredibly charismatic person, and he holds a lot of progressive ideals ([check out his Wikipedia page](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snoop_Dogg)). But, unlike the vast majority of Democratic politicians, he uses language that is accessible to non-college educated people. \n\nObviously, he has a lot of baggage:  he has been arrested numerous times, he admits that was a literal pimp for some time, he has a history of chronic (pun intended) marijuana use and his early music is rife with misogyny, homophobia and glorification of violence. \n\nBut\u2026stick with me, I think that all of these minuses can be turned into pluses. To start with, it makes him very relatable. Far more people without college degrees have had run ins with the law than those with university education. Also, for those of us who remember the 90s, you know that misogynistic and homophobic language were somewhat common during that time. This does not make it right, but I think most of the people who lived through that era also can look back with shame at some of the things that we said. So, again, we can find a reflection of our human flaws and or eventual progress in Snoop. And that feels good. \n\nHe'll probably have to stop smoking weed in order to run for president but, legalization of marijuana is a political winner. Most Americans have used marijuana and will not fault him for his past usage. He\u2019ll absolutely need to earnestly apologize for the pimping. That\u2019s pretty bad. \n\n**3.** **Snoop gets attacked from all sides**\n\nHere comes the best part. If Snoop were to announce a presidential candidacy it would infuriate a lot of people and that is exactly what we need. To start with, a lot of super-smart people would decry the state of democracy and write super-smart editorials in super-smart publications like *The New Yorker* and *The Washington Post*, just as they did when Trump announced in 2015. And how do you think that is going to look to the non-college educated voters? How effective were such attacks on Trump\u2019s candidacy?\n\nRight, so we have them out of the way, who\u2019s next? Likely the woke Twitterati will go after him for the aforementioned sexism and homophobia of his early work. Snoop can say, \u201clook, I said a lot of bad stuff in the past, and I\u2019m sorry, but we need to look forward and start getting this country back on the right track and not get stuck picking on people for what they said twenty or thirty years ago\u201d. I\u2019m sure he can come up with a much better way of saying that because he\u2019s way cooler than I am but that is a very popular sentiment in this country and it\u2019s what millions of people want to hear. It would drive Republicans nuts because their whole strategy is to portray the Dems as woke college kids who are out of touch with the average American. Even now they get scared when liberal media figures attack \u201ccancel culture\u201d. Why else would a leading conservative publication have been inspired [to write this](https:\/\/spectatorworld.com\/topic\/bill-maher-not-conservatives-side\/)?\n\nFinally, we have the racists to deal with. This is the easiest of all. The GOP is getting pretty good and racist dog whistling, but this would totally throw them off their game. So, let them hurl their hateful rhetoric at Snoop and see what happens. It will totally turn off black and Latinx voters, groups that [Trump actually picked up votes from in 2020](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-54972389). Also, the Republican love to paint Dems and wimpy crybabies who are totally out of touch with \u201ccommon people\u201d and to be fair, the Dems kind of play the part, but just let them try that with Snoop\u2026\n\n**4.** **Snoop wins in a landslide**\n\nHaving withstood attacks from the chattering elites of media and Washington, from the \u201cwoke\u201d snowflakes and from the alt-right Nazis, Snoop has more broad support than any politician since Roosevelt. I\u2019m not making this up. This is what Americans want and this is what America needs. [Have a look at this study](https:\/\/hiddentribes.us\/) which shows that most people are super turned off by activists on both the right and the left. Someone who has demonstrated a refusal to be cowed by those groups would be incredibly popular. \n\nMoreover, Snoop\u2019s fame and charisma would likely bring out millions of poor voters and young voters who are historically difficult to turn out at the polls as they feel disaffected by politics and politicians. Snoop\u2019s campaign would be incredibly empowering to the most marginalized groups in the United States. This is a campaign that would work. \n\n**5.** **The Dogg Administration:** \n\nOK, will probably have to start calling him Calvin Broadus but that was fun to write. \n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of people are going to say, \u201cSnoop Dogg is completely unqualified for the office of President of the United States\u201d. To which I might ask, \u201cAnd Donald Trump was?\u201d To which someone may counter, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s presidency was an utter disaster\u201d and I would then say, \u201cyes, but Donald Trump is insane, and Snoop is not.\u201d \n\nI concede, he would need a lot of help and he would need to read up on the issues. But, that\u2019s true for all presidents. There are plenty of people who would be more than happy to advise him on tax codes, national debt, foreign policy and the like. And I think he\u2019s got the brains to make the right choices. \n\nFinally, we have one elephant in the room. Does Snoop want to do this? I think he could be persuaded. If anyone who has read this far knows him, please show it to him! \n\nChange my view, people! I\u2019m worried that the Dems are about to get clobbered in 2022 and 2024 and I\u2019m pretty convinced that this can work. I\u2019m more than ready to entertain other ideas, however.","112":"It's unfortunate how you see nobody mentioning the stupidity with copypastas, only people that dick ride them.

I support abortion, and the broader concept of bodily autonomy. I very much believe in \"my body, my choice.\" So this is NOT a debate about abortion.\n\nMy issue is with the fact that [Norma McCorvey (aka Roe)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Norma_McCorvey) changed her stance on abortion on more than one occasion. After the ruling was passed, she \"found religion\" and became an anti-abortion activist, supporting politicians who were against abortion, and regretted her role in the decision to legalize abortion. She said that she was being used as a pawn for abortion activists. But then later, on her deathbed, she changed her stance again and said that her conversion to Christianity was financially motivated and that she had been paid to speak against abortion.\n\nShe went back and forth on a number of other things too, as you will see in the above link.\n\nI feel that if she had remained a strong advocate for abortion throughout her life, she would be remembered as an activist who fought for women's rights. But instead she's known as \"Roe\", which is basically similar to \"Jane Doe\". People who are against abortion have plenty of things they could use as leverage. They could easily argue that Roe changing her stance on abortion and converting to Christianity is proof that she didn't really believe in abortion, and would have been happy if the ruling was overturned, or that she was mentally unstable and didn't know what she really wanted, since she kept changing her mind about various things.\n\nSo yes. Like I said earlier, I am pro-choice and do not want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned. But if it is, there needs to be a new advocate. A new voice who people would remember the same way we remember folks like Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony. I know there are things that people can use as leverage against them, but they are not John\/Jane Does. Most people know who they are without having to look them up.

This post is almost a ChangeMyView piece. I have this opinion, but I could be swayed:\n\nThere seems to be a lot of talk about \"sexual compatibility\" in finding a decent mate. Do you know what completely screws that up? Menopause, around age 45-55, is inevitable. That's like 20-30 years of increased sexual rejection and related sexual frustration. So--unless most guys have a low libido--for a child free male, getting into a monogamous relationship is against their best sexual interest.\n\nI realize sex isn't the be-all and end-all for a relationship. It's just a significant part. So for guys who do not have children and do not want children, getting into a strictly monogamous relationship will eventually screw them over.\n\nThis may not be an unpopular opinion, but I'm also of the belief that most people would cheat under the right circumstances and with a near impossibility of being found out. I have never wanted to nor been in such a circumstance, but I think it could happen to nearly anyone (besides perhaps certain Muslims or Roman Catholics who would risk death rather than do anything near cheating). \n\nAnyway, this belief supports my opinion that a monogamous relationship is bad because *if* either person does sleep with other people, it's more likely they'll keep it a secret. Non-monogamous relationships usually have that kind of stuff open and freely communicated.","131":"Just to clarify, this is a non-political post and I would like to politely ask commenters **to not involve politics in this topic.** \n\nI see plenty of posts by women in late 20s' and 30s' who constantly worry about finding a partner to have a child with. \n\nOf course, if they truly want that and it's an informed choice (based on more than societal expectations and fear of not being loved if they don't 'give' a man a child), then they should pursue what brings them happiness. \n\nSadly, often women are pressured and 'rushed' into something they may not even want, because of these two main factors: \n\n\n\n\n1. Ingraining in women's brain from an early childhood that becoming a mother is just what they'll do one day.\n\nIn more detail: Gendered toys, especially baby dolls, glorification and misrepresentation of motherhood in media and fiction, language used towards girls\/young women like 'when you're going to be a mother...' and more subtle clues that this is exactly women's destiny, without allowing them having an agency over this matter. Basically, taking from us an opportunity to think critically when it comes to childbearing.\n\n\n\n\n2. Men valuing women's ability to reproduce above anything else that makes them a human being. Luckily, not all men.\n\nIn more detail. Women have been convinced that love between them and a man can happen only with an addition of a child, with the majority of men excluding any other option than biological fatherhood. For most, infertility seems to be a dealbreaker, and in some countries it's even a valid reason for a quick divorce or an annulation of a marriage. This is utterly sad because it tells us that women are not worth anything as humans and have no other value in the society.\n\n\n\n\nMy thoughts on this were around for a while, but I decided to post on reddit after hearing from one of the closest friend that he would break a long-term relationship with a woman he claims he loves, if it turned out she can't bear children, which means he prioritised hypothetical, non-existing beings over a person who thinks, loves and has emotions.\n\n\nTo sum up, this obsession around becoming a mother\/father as a must, harms women who don't have partners yet and are afraid that their time is running out and they will never experience love if they miss their fertility years.\n\n\n\n**If you're comfortable with it, please specify your age and gender in brackets.**","132":"I'm sick of people saying that voices aren't inherently sexual, they are. The pitch of one's voice is a secondary sex characteristic, secondary sex characteristics are an evolutionary benefit that makes mates see you as more attractive and gives you an advantage for mating.

I also want to say this isn't an argument against talking in public, just people who delude themselves into thinking vooces aren't inherently sexual.","133":"There's an inherent contradiction in having a job that requires you to enforce laws, some of them unjust, while also being responsible for helping people in need, and then go going and stop a riot. In ancient Rome, they had different jobs for these tasks. \n\nThey had some public servants that put down riots, some that settled disputes between people, and everyone wasn't a massive pussy back then so they could defend themselves against school shooters. Just think about how weird it is that a person is tasked with beating down a protester at an anti-gun riot because they were out of line, then the next day the same person has to go to the suburbs and decide if it's indecent that some woman is doing gardening without panties, at which point they get a call that some kid is stuck on a roof on a farm he climbed up on because he shot a bull in the testicles with his bb-gun and the bull is very angry (all of these stories are real things that have fallen onto cops to solve).","134":"One of the arguments for vegetarianism is to reduce the  suffering of animals, based upon the principle that less suffering is better.  However, I'm not sure if most vegetarians know that there is an equivalent principle for human beings, called the non-aggression principle (or sometimes the harm principles).\n\nIn a nutshell, it says that the only ethical laws are laws that prevent people from harming or stealing from each other, because anything else constitutes aggression.  For example, the libertarian party has this in their platform:\n\n> Criminal laws should be limited in their application to violations of the rights of others through force or fraud, or to deliberate actions that place others involuntarily at significant risk of harm. Therefore, we favor the repeal of all laws creating \u201ccrimes\u201d without victims \n\nAnd while I am not a 100% libertarian myself, I do read libertarian publications like Reason, and one thing I've always seen that they do an excellent job of holding government accountable for the harm it causes, regardless of whom is in charge.  I think you also have to respect a political philosophy that basically wants to leave you alone and let you do what you want.  \n\nOf course there is room for debate about how harm is defined, but as a principle it is difficult to argue with- libertarianism means less harm, less coercion, and less suffering.  To me it seems like something vegetarians should also support as its an extension of their principles.","135":"What even is Lichtenstein? Monaco?

Whether it's for self defense or just for sports and hunting. \n\nI'm from the Netherlands myself and I've been practicing sport shooting for over 10 years.

It was full time, 35 hrs per week, office-based role but considering the duties it could be easily done remotely and hours could be made flexible.

Lots of girls, feminists and misandrists in media and online would probably think otherwise. Their arguments are usually that since they are men they can't talk about women's issues or that it's their body and their choice, \"My body, my choice.\". But those arguments are pretty stupid and can be ripped apart. \n\nFirstly, \"men can't have a say in women's issues.\" Most women issues are related to men doing something that harms women, as in something sexist. So if men stopped getting involved in women's issues, we would have practically no issues in the first place. This also makes no sense, because if issues are being caused by sexist men, and you don't want other men to get involved that won't help. Because those sexist men are more likely to listen to another guy instead of a women. If I hate all people with red hair, and red-haired people start advocating against it, and someone who isn't a redhead tries to talk me out of hating on redheads I would be more inclined to listen. Because A, they are someone like me, and B they aren't a redhead. So to deny non-sexist men a chance to talk in this is simple stupid. \n\nAnother point I can make to this is, just because someone isn't apart of a community doesn't mean they can't have good opinions on it. \n\nAnd something that is also common is these girls bashing anyone who disagrees, by a lot. If you have an opinion remotely or even slighty different you're a \"bigot\", \"incel\" and \"women hater\". Even if you have good reason or don't force your opinion on others. \n\nSecondly, \"My body, my choice\". Everyone should have the ability to make their own choices in life but some choices just don't work out in good ways or have negative consequences. And yes, freedom of choice but not freedom of judgement or consequence. \"My body, my choice\" doesn't apply to all situations. For example, if I kill someone but I don't want to go to jail. Thats me as in my body, choosing not to go to jail. However you can't do that, and you wouldn't argue that I should have the right to do that, wouldn't you? If someone is slicing their wrist, mentally ill and gets dragged into a mental hospital, you wouldn't go and say, \"their body, their choice!\". (But I know some of yall weirdos prob would) \n\nThirdly, why exactly should men have a say on abortion? Well all of my previous writing answers this question. But abortion also affects and involves men in someway. The man is part of the reason the baby exist, meaning the have a direct say in matters related to it. It takes two to tango, the women and the man. What if the man wants the baby and the girl doesn't? Should he just have so sit there and do nothing even though that's also his baby? I think abortion should be 50\/50 meaning both parents get a say and work things out. \n\nI don't know how to solve the issue if the man wants it and the girl doesn't. But I believe the man has the right to discuss his view on it.","167":"Somebody let their cat out and it got hurt? Their fault. Somebody voluntarily went out to buy a pet and never got insurance or even saved money for their medical expenses and now they're sick with no treatmemt because \"It's too expensive\"? Also their fault. I couldn't care less about the pity parties people like that throw and frankly they shouldn't ever have pets. It's completely on them to not consider that they should keep their pets safe and ensure that they have access to medical care.","168":"I think guns should be heavily restricted, and made extremely difficult to get, because the civilian populace, overall, will be less prone to being killed.\n\n\n\n**\"But if guns are taken away, people will just use knives or bombs instead.\"**\n\nI'd rather have bombings or stabbings, than shootings. \n\nReasons for stabbings over shootings:\n\n1.) I can outrun a person with a knife and keep my distance from them, but I can't outrun bullets. \n\n2.) Bullets can go through walls and kill people, but a knife can't. Even your own house can't protect you from bullets most of the time.\n\n3.) Gunshot wounds are generally more deadly than stab wounds, because bullets hit with enough force to blow apart flesh, and they can also break apart inside the body, causing further damage.\n\n4.) Guns can kill multiple people A LOT faster and easier than a knife.\n\n5.) For law enforcement, dealing with a suspect that has a semi-automatic firearm, is far more difficult and dangerous for them than dealing with a knife wielder. \n\n6.) There are lots of stab-resistant clothing around, they're easier to make from scratch, and they're pretty effective. \n\nReason for bombings:\n\n1.) Most people either don't want to go through the trouble of creating and preparing a bomb, or they aren't smart enough to even make it in the first place. They are more difficult to use, and less easily accessible than a gun. This would probably explain why they aren't used as often as guns.\n\nSo yes, while killers will try to find many other ways to kill people, I'd rather deal with those, than deal with shootings.\n\n\n\n**\"But u\/Heinrich64, criminals will still find ways to get guns no matter what, won't they?\"**\n\nThe reason why they've been able to get guns in the first place, is due to stealing from guns stores & legal gun owners. No gun stores or legal gun owners = guns being far less likely to fall into the hands of criminals. \n\nAnd no, guns aren't smuggled into this country nearly as often as you may think. [Actually, it's quite the opposite.](https:\/\/news.harvard.edu\/gazette\/story\/2022\/02\/stopping-toxic-flow-of-gun-traffic-from-u-s-to-mexico\/) \n\n[The US is the reason why so many criminals in Latin American countries are getting their hands on powerful weapons.](https:\/\/www.economist.com\/the-americas\/2019\/05\/23\/guns-from-the-united-states-are-flooding-latin-america)\n\nAlso, many other countries have banned guns, and they don't have nearly as many shooting **MURDERS** as we do. And don't even think of mentioning their stabbing deaths, because we all know the death count would've been higher if the perps had guns, and my reasoning is explained in previous points. Stop comparing guns to knives. It's extremely dumb.\n\n\n\n**\"But what about my freedom?\"**\n\nIf your freedom to play around with an overpowered weapon is more important than someone's life, then that means you're the kind of person that doesn't deserve a gun. If you're not willing to give up a weapon when you're legally required to do so, then that also means you're the kind of person that doesn't deserve a gun. \n\nIt is of my opinion that those who are willing to give up their power for the sake of others, are the ones who truly deserve the freedom to wield it. I personally don't trust people who aren't willing to give up their power for the benefit of society, or when they are legally required to do so; you're basically admitting that you're a potential violent criminal. And don't even try to question whether or not the civilian populace would be better off without guns, 'cause you know damn well it would be, as lots of innocent people would still be alive today, if it was extremely hard, or impossible, to get them. \n\n\n\n**\"But u\/Heinrich64, how the fuck am I supposed to defend myself or my property?\"**\n\nThere's pepper spray, tasers, self-defense knives, and even knife resistant clothing available. Hell, get a fucking axe, a machete, or even a fucking katana, and chop the bastard up, I don't care. If the perp doesn't have a gun, then you don't need one either. Just be prepared, be well equipped, know how to fight, and be good at running. You don't need to pretend like you're fucking Rambo. \n\nAlso, there's security systems, cameras, and window gates to help protect your house. And if the perp doesn't have a gun, at least he can't shoot through your house.\n\n\n\n**\"But what if they have a gun?\"**\n\nLike I said before, they wouldn't even have guns in the first place, if they weren't made available to the public. That's where they get most, or possibly, all of their guns. No guns available to the public means no guns on the streets. The Uvalde Shooter purchased his guns legally as soon as he turned 18. If there were no gun stores or gun owners around to steal or buy from, how difficult do you think it would've been to get them? If he had went into that school with just a knife, how many more kids do you think would've survived? \n\n\n\n**\"But what happens when the government tries to oppress us?\"**\n\nOk, let's take a look at what's happening in Ukraine right now.  Ukraine has relied, **heavily**, upon Western military equipment to keep Russian forces at bay. And no, it isn't just guns,  they've also sent Javelin anti-tank missiles, Stinger anti-aircraft, and Switchblade drones. Now, imagine if Ukraine didn't receive any military equipment from any nation at all. They would've been SOL, and they had their own military equipment! This basically proves that guns alone is not enough to even put up a fight against our current military, if they really wanted to fuck us over. What the fuck are your measly little guns gonna do against tanks, armored cars, and jets? This isn't the 1800s anymore, where all the militaries had were single-shot rifles and some cannons. Nowadays, they have all sorts of shit they can use to take you out, if they wanted to.\n\nAnd that's not all. You also have to account for the possibility of civilians fighting against you, in favor for the government! So basically, it doesn't matter if you have guns or not, you're fucked either way. And even if you somehow, by the grace of God, win this hypothetical civil war, you would still lose a shit ton of people, and the country will be in shambles afterwards. \n\n\n\nAnd lastly, I am not implying that guns are the only reason people keep being murdered here in the US. I'm well aware that our shitty culture and lack of support for the mentally ill are the other big things that lead to homicides. But don't sit up here and pretend like easy access to overpowered weapons hasn't played a part in anyone's death at all. You're just deluding yourself. I mean, for fucks sake, gunshots are common where I live. I don't feel safe in my own home, since a stray bullet can easily go through my house and kill my ass. Now, ask yourself, which would save me from being killed by a stray bullet: Having my own semi-automatic rifle, or the perp not having a gun in the first place?","169":"For those who followed the Jubileum parade there is no need to explain why.\n\nThis little boy was literally at his naughtiest, displaying an annoying show of authority against his embarrassed mother, Kate Middleton, while his siblings were having normal posture and behaviour.\n\nOf course, the commenters did not dare to interpret the kid's act as bad, they just said the \u201dPrince Louis stole the show\u201d or something.\n\nI am really glad he is not first in line for the British throne!\n\nFor those who didn't see him, here is a scene.","170":"as a movie buff who watches many movies in theaters and on streaming every year, one of the biggest nights of the year for me is the academy awards. i\\`ve been watching the full ceremony since 2018 and have watched every night since and one of my favorite categories of fun facts is oscar fun facts.\n\nhowever, whenever i talk about anything oscar related on reddit, i get people aggressively telling me about how the oscars suck and even questioning why i watch it. although its perfectly fine to not want to watch the oscars, i find people\\`s attitudes about me choosing to do so to be pretentious at best and douchebaggy at worst.\n\ni honestly fail to see how me choosing to watch the oscars affects you in anyway. if anyone is negatively affected by me watching the oscars, it\\`s me. that ceremony often runs very late into the night and i get tired very easily. just because i enjoy something doesn\\`t mean that i try to force it on other people. no one in my house is forced to watch the oscars with me. this is my thing and if other people choose to join me, they are welcome to. \n\nbesides, is it any surprise that a film buff likes to watch the oscars? a quick browse through my posting history will make it very apparent that i am a lover of the moving image. i have very strong opinions about movies and i enjoy good natured debate on the subject. as such, why is it such a surprise that i like to watch the oscars? and again, it has nothing to do with you. i can spend my sunday evenings however i please. if i choose to spend my sunday evening tap dancing on top of the empire state building while wearing a shark hat and yelling \"paprika\" over and over, i\\`ll do it. \n\ni don\\`t tell you how to live your life. please extend me the same courtesy.","171":"[removed]","172":"[removed]","173":"The smallest things trigger liberals.\n\nDid you know that you've sat next to a gun owner in public before and nothing happened?\n\nDid you know that kids can be taught to be colorblind way more easily than they can be taught to be \"anti-racist?\"\n\nDid you know that many of your male friends (lol, acquaintances more like it) have been thoroughly emasculated by liberal society and they know that you'll judge them if they show any sign of desiring to fulfill a traditionally-masculine role in society, so they don't tell you?\n\nDid you know that immigration and culture mixing is literally the basis of the collapse of American society?\n\nAs a liberal, you probably know all these things intellectually, but your emotions get the best of you and you lash out.

Rappers and artists in these genres for years have been allowed to get away with the most despicable and disgusting comments and lyrics directed towards gay people, all the while being praised and showered with awards, record deals and positive publicity, even from those who acted as though they cared about gay rights and against homophobia.\n\nHowever, in recent years, we have been seeing a wave of new gay rappers who have taken the rap and hip-hop communities by storm... such as Lil Nas X and Tyler the Creator, amongst others. Yet, this new brand of gay-positive rappers has created significant anger among many of the still-largely homophobic community. In an interview, Lil Nas X says:\n\n> \"The honest truth is, I don\u2019t want to speak on a lot of the homophobia within rap because I feel like this is a very dangerous playing field... It\u2019s more for my own safety rather than anything else\" [[source](https:\/\/www.billboard.com\/music\/rb-hip-hop\/lil-nas-x-talks-homophobia-rap-safety-9613308\/)].\n\n...so, even despite his success, Lil Nas X still finds himself in danger from the entrenched homophobe mainstream of the rap world. Even from the progressive voices of America, only small amounts of condemnation is ever levied against this overwhelming anti-gay hate. Even the rapper Da Baby, who received some criticism for his recent homophobic remarks in 2021, continues to put out records and songs on major labels with significant positive attention and success.\n\nAs such, it is clear that a reckoning in the hip-hop and rap communities needs to occur to eliminate this entrenched homophobic majority within their ranks, so, I am very excited to see the increased queering of rap and hip-hop with new gay artists. If anything, I hope and very much advocate for a new army of gay rappers come to dominate the genre and push out the hate-filled homophobic rappers. I want to hear new songs from rappers about their gay experience, about their gay love, about promoting gayness in the hip-hop world, and making rap more queer. Furthermore, once they take over, I hope that all homophobic rappers and their songs are purged and eliminated, their record contracts canceled, their music removed from platforms, because this would seem to be the only way to cure homophobia within this community. I mean, come on, why are we still condoning homophobia from this group when it is not being tolerated in literally ANY OTHER domain? Anyone who still listens to homophobic rap and doesn't speak out against it is themselves either homophobic or are homophobia enablers.","185":"Us and Taiwan claim Taiwan as independent, China claims it as theirs.

The central question was whether an Op-Ed that referred to Depp\u2019s abuse without actually including his name represented malicious defamation.  In Depp\u2019s own words he did abuse Heard so she can\u2019t possibly defame him by referring to the same, and the fact that studios continued to sever ties with him as he was imploding his own career through dangerous and unprofessional behavior can hardly be said to be under her control.\n\nFor whatever reason the above recording was not included in the trial but ample evidence was provided with multiple witnesses corroborating that Depp was indeed physically abusive.  Instead dangerous victim blaming stereotypes were reinforced, she was grilled for not seeking medical attention, pressing criminal charges or flawlessly documenting every instance of his abuse with photos and videos.   Even though it is well documented that a large portion of abuse survivors do none of the above.\n\nHeard was unsympathetic to a jury, most likely lied about or distorted some details  and participated in reactive abuse but none of that negates the fact that she was an abuse survivor as she stated in the Op-Ed.  Depp has become the face of DARVO, his courtroom behavior almost perfectly mirroring the demeanor of Brian Laundrie in his last recorded interaction with Gabby Petito before he would murder her.  It\u2019s difficult to see the trial itself as anything but an extension of Depp\u2019s abuse considering that he voiced a desire to shame and humiliate Heard in retaliation for seeking separation from him.","207":"being criticized for being or doing something perceived as feminine is not sexism against men its misogyny. being told you throw like a girl is misogyny. it's totally fine and good to talk about the effects toxic masculinity has on men and how the paitricarchy effects men but to act like you're the sole load-bearer in instances where people are actively putting down women isnt it.","208":"In May 2021, Biden had a photo op at the white house in which [he signed an anti-Asian hate crime into law](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2021\/05\/20\/998599775\/biden-to-sign-the-covid-19-hate-crimes-bill-as-anti-asian-american-attacks-rise).

And while you might think this is happening in \"MAGA country\" or whatever, the cities with the biggest rise in AAPI hate crimes are Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. \n\nAs Asians are dealing with concerns about their own safety, they are also seeing academic opportunities closed off to them, and the people they counted on to defend their civil rights turning their back on them.  For example the incoming Biden administration [dropped its racial discrimination lawsuit against Yale](https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/justice-department-drops-yale-lawsuit-9587f156426b3cd905be373e41bb12d7) based upon a complaint from the Asian American Coalition for Education coalition .\n\nIf AAPI hate crimes are up 4x in one year, especially in America's largest cities (that are also tourist destinations for Asian visitors), and the administration refuses to defend Asian Americans civil rights in education, why should [BTS give them a photo op](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2022\/05\/31\/1102244756\/k-pop-stars-bts-went-to-the-white-house-to-talk-about-anti-asian-hate-crimes)?

Many people in other countries cover unimportant US news to show how much better off they are, then they have the audacity to call Americans self-centered and ignorant.\n\nThe U.K. does this especially when it comes to things like health care and socio-economics.

My position is that in an evolving, chaotic, precarious situation with conflicting reports and a constant stream of unreliable information leading decision making, we shouldn't be blaming individuals for the deaths of kids until we know what led them to make the choices they did. In addition, there is rampant misinformation going around about the nature of the police response.\n\nHere's what we know, [according to this timeline](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2022\/05\/26\/uvalde-school-shooting-timeline\/):\n\nAt 11:27, Ramos crashes his car into the school.\n\nAt 11:30, [according to this source,](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/05\/27\/us\/uvalde-texas-elementary-school-shooting-friday\/index.html) the first call to police is made.\n\nAt 11:31, [according to this source,](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/timeline-shooting-texas-elementary-school-unfolded\/story?id=84966910), an ISD officer who heard the reports immediately speeds to the school and tries to engage the shooter, accidentally confronting a teacher instead.\n\nAt 11:33, Ramos enters the school and begins shooting.\n\n**At 11:35, two minutes later, three police enter the building to confront him and two are shot.** Four more arrive and **also** enter the building.\n\nFrom 11:37 to 11:44, the shooter fires rounds in intervals.\n\nAt 11:51, the police sergeant and additional officers arrived.\n\n**At 12:03, it is estimated as many as 19 local police officers may have been in the hall outside the classroom.**\n\nAt 12:10, the first federal agents arrive.\n\nAt 12:21, the shooter fires through the door and the police take positions further back in the hallway with federal agents.\n\nAt 12:50, the door to the classroom is opened using a key and the shooter is killed by a member of the Border Patrol.\n\nThere was never a time where Uvalde police completely left the building. There was never a time where they all retreated outside the school and waited for help from federal agents. I am not commenting whatsoever on how they treated parents, or the officers who went in to save their kids. I'm pointing out that numerous officers immediately engaged the shooter, multiple were shot, and they never abandoned the school. As time passes, only more officers enter the building.\n\nCould they have been cowardly? Absolutely. But the commanding officer who assessed the situation as no longer an active shooter and now a barricaded subject almost certainly did not do so out of cowardice. The shooter shot volleys of bullets through the door at officers and was firing infrequently. I can't say it's impossible to believe there's scenarios that lead a commanding officer to likely and reasonably believe there's no longer students being shot in the classroom.\n\nI certainly would not blame the individual Uvalde police officers, many of which charged in and were shot at and stayed regardless, who tried to burst through the door but couldn't while the shooter was firing through it. I will reserve that judgement until I know more details about the shooting, because the last thing I want to do is pile on with the rest of the internet to tell a bunch of first responders they're responsible for the death of kids when they risked their lives and were told to stand back on either bad commands or bad information. And I don't want to say the commanding officer was responsible when I have no idea what information he was using to make his judgement.\n\nI think it's terrible that anyone is forced to confront a situation where an active shooter more heavily armed than themselves is made accountable for any and all of their actions before anybody knows what really happened. It is always easy to pin the blame for Chernobyl on technicians who failed to follow procedure on a routine and normally innocuous safety check for the plants' meltdown. It is always easy to blame the physician who accidentally overdosed a patient because he read the chart wrong after twenty years on the job. It is always easy to pin the blame on the grandmother who accidentally ran over her grandchild because she didn't check her rearview camera backing out of the garage for the child's death. What all these scenarios essentially miss is the systemic issues that come into play with these tragedies, that human error will always be part of the system and that confronting individuals who made a mistake in a crucial situation is a lazy way to convince oneself if not for this *bad* or *incompetent* individual, these things wouldn't happen. Maybe we need redundant systems in nuclear reactors to ensure that meltdowns are less likely when low probability events predictably align. Maybe we need automated dosage for patients so that a sleepy doctor doesn't result in a death. Maybe we should make new cars detect objects behind them and alert the driver like many do now.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, we should reserve judgement on the action of officers in an active school shooting until we know more about it, and focus a bit more on the systems that lead to a situation where a botched police response means a dozen more children dead at the hands of a killer.","233":"This should not even be a conversation.

That right there is $1.25 for the combined amount of beef and bun for a single burger.  \n\n\n I buy a romaine lettuce (enough for at least 8 burgers) for $1.50. A beefsteak tomato is $1.25 (enough slices for 5 burgers). Bottle of BBQ sauce\/ketchup\/ for a dollar each. Bottle of mayo $2 each. Pack of frozen onion rings for $1.50 (enough for 25 burgers if you put 2 on each burger). $1.50 for Great Value season fries which are bomb as f\\*ck.  2 liter of Dr Pepper for $2.19 or Dr Thunder for 67 cents. Either way its enough for like 6 glasses of soda. If you want to get kinky you could grab a jar of pickles too for like $2.

Because every time a new President is elected, they basically undo everything the previous President did, only to have the next President restore it again. A recent example being Trump withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement only to have Biden re-instate it. The next President, if they are a Republican, will most likely withdraw the US from the agreement again.\n\nMy proposal: Rather than automatically holding a Presidential Election every four years, they should instead, during the primaries, have the people vote on whether or not the President is doing a good job and therefore should remain in office. If the majority of the people like the current President, they will stay in office for another four years; no need to hold an election. As long as the people keep voting for the President, they will remain in office; no term limits. If, on the other hand, the majority of the people \"vote the President out of the ~~tribe~~ White House\", the incumbent President will leave office on January 20 of the next year, and the newly-elected President will take office. The previous President will NOT be eligible to be re-elected at a later date.\n\nThe system would work similarly to a recall election (at least how it works in my state; not sure about other states), where the people would vote on whether or not the President should remain in office, and at the same time, vote for their preferred candidate in the primaries. If the majority of the people vote for the President to remain in office, that will be the end for another four years. However, if the majority of the people think the current President should NOT remain in office, then the election would proceed as it usually does when the incumbent President is not eligible to run again, with the Democratic and Republican candidates who recived the most votes in the primaries hold debates, the people will vote as usual in November, and the candidate with the most votes becomes the next President.\n\nOh, and they should eliminate the Electoral College too.","291":"[deleted]","292":"Don\u2019t get me wrong, MLK was a great speaker and movement leader, and his leadership of the Montgomery Bus Boycott and his March one Washington were fabulous and influential.\n\nBut on the other hand, LBJ was the one who pushed repeatedly to pass civil rights and who made maneuvers to convince the right people to support it and who signed the bills and who enforced civil rights laws.

It occurs to me that in the medical context if we are prepared to define 'death' or 'the end of life' as being linked to the ending of neural activity in the brain or cardiac activity in the heart then we should have a logical reason to accept that the 'beginning of life' should coincide with the beginning of cardiac activity in the heart and neurological activity in the brain. Both of which occur at some point prior to birth. \n\nPro-choicer argue that a women's ownership of her body gives her the right to abort a pregnancy. The way this is typically thought of is as a biological version of \"castle doctrine\". Under castle doctrine if someone is trespassing on your land you can legally kill them. For the pro-choicer it doesn't matter if the foetus is a life or a person. What matters is that women have the right to choose.\n\nIt occurs to me that this isn't a great argument. Just because you have the right to make a decision doesn't mean it is a morally good decision to make. I have the right to go up to a stranger on the street and tell them that their face is so ugly it makes me want to puke. If i say this I haven't violated their rights in anyway but I have still done something wrong. I think the pro-choice activist has to go further than merely proving that women have the right to abort pregnancy. They have to show that it is an ethical decision to make. \n\nI think the only way the pro-choicer can do this is to demonstrate that the foetus never constitutes \"a life\" or \"a person\". However the way we define death seems to indicate that these foetuses should count as 'alive' in the relevant sense. \n\nI still consider myself pro-choice because (1) I still believe in some biological version of castle doctrine - even if enacting it harms something that counts as a person, and (2) I reckon that we can perhaps think of \"life\" and \"death\" on more of a continuum. Even if we define the moment of death as the moment where neurological activity stops those who are approaching death seem to loose their personhood well before this arbitrary point. They also tend to loose their personhood gradually over a long period of time. It's not unthinkable that a foetus with neurological activity is only beginning to gain personhood and hasn't yet achieved it.","297":"[deleted]","298":"Wall Street people and traders are incredibly overpaid for something that isn\u2019t real work.

People who say Calories in = calories out is all that matters. (CICO) and every body is the same.. the problem is, it seems like this is the popular opinion (or lie that's believed to be true)  \n\n\nYeah, lowering your caloric intake does make you lose weight, but these people take it to a levle where they say 1000 calories of fast food is the same for weight loss as 1000 calories of healhty food. because CICO.   \n\n\nThis also doesn't take into consideration that the nutrients eaten also affect what sort of processes your body does, which also use calories.. Without cholesterol and HDL's your body doesn't convert a lot of hormones, so that's energy you're not using. other nutrients are available immediately in a food source, and others are found via bioconverting, which is also taking up energy.  \n\n\nNor does this include any sort of thing such as certain people excrete food much faster than their body can absorb all the calories out of the food, or people with hypothyroidism which alone would telll you bodies are not the same.  \n\n\nSo it's still calories out, but they think it's \"Eat 1000 calories, run the same mile, and you'll have the same out come. Eat all that ice cream you want until 1000 calories everyday\"  \n\n\nthen they'll say anything against it is against the science or against thermodynamics.. like a missionary reading off a pamphlet.

Then they'll show you their Grateful Dead concert paraphernalia and offer to smoke you up.  They're decent folks, if a little dim due to over-medication.\n\nWhen Gen-X was growing up, we assumed we'd die in nuclear war (aka red skies at night), but it turned out the soviet union was the paper tiger, crumbling before we even left high school.  Our new world order had the US sending troops to a bunch of places like Panama, Mogadishu, Kuwait, and Bosnia that we could barely find on a map, but we never worried about socialists.\n\n9\/11 changed everything (kids ask your parents), and by the middle of the decade, it was pretty normal to hear about some guy try to blow up a plane with his shoe and then him and a few of his closest friends getting flown to Guantanamo to get waterboarded.  Since Islamic terrorists were pretty scary, we also had the comic relief terrorists, which were the Eco-terrorists.  For example there was one group called ELF who would burn down empty buildings (which would then be rebuilt).\n\nIn the midst of that, there were also the occasional anti-government terrorists, labeled as right-wing, like Tim McVeigh who blew up a Federal building with fertilizer.  (Redneck engineering champion. They rebuilt that building too - unfortunately it wasn't empty.)\n\n### Socialist Revolution = Hurricane Bob\n\nBut where were the socialists?  Well, we finally found out in the Trump years, when they figured out that a global pandemic was a good time to start a riot (since people are home doing nothing anyway).  There was rioting and looting in dozes of cities causing billions of dollars of damage - basically as much damage as Hurricane Bob,  (Kids, ask your parents --  actually don't bother they won't remember either.)\n\n(Note - I am giving credit to the socialists for the BLM\/Antifa riots because I saw the role that the DSA-LA played here in southern california, using reddit and twitter and their own website to organize, and based on the screenshots Andy Ngo posted in Portland that were similar.)\n\nI don't know how it was in other areas, but here in SoCal, the second that the national guard was called out, they folded like a cheap umbrella (which was incidentally their primary weaponry) and fled as fast as their skateboards could carry them.  And the working class that they claimed to represent was cheering the national guard, not them.\n\n### More capitalism, please.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that people wanted capitalism - they wanted to be able to go back to work and to school and to the mall and to their sportsball games etc etc, which is what happened and where we are now.  So while the socialist movements of the 60s were able to help end the war in Vietnam, this one accomplished absolutely nothing.\n\nAnd while I don't think the government took the socialists all that seriously, they did a little - calling out the national guard in many states, and then trump deployed federal troops to portland to protect buildings, which meant that antifa had someone there to fight every day.  When a big part of your identity is based around being the final nail in the coffin of capitalism, that has to be some decent validation after 20+ years.  At least they weren't being ignored any more.\n\nThat lasted all of six months, until the insurrection, when Trump and his supporters literally stormed the capital and killing everybody.  Okay, not really, but it was fun for the establishment left to pretend, and the NYT really did do its best, claiming a capitol police officer was killed.  Now of course we know a lot more, like a lot of the protestors were let into the capitol, the FBI and BLM were both in attendance, and the vast majority haven't been charged with anything much more than trespassing.\n\nAnd of course establishment Democrats are still beating the \"Republicans are dangerous\" drum for all its worth, investigating PTA moms and blaming mass shootings on Republicans because they read a 180 page manifesto by a self-described authoritarian leftist, hybrid nazi, and green nationalist, who hated conservatives and fox news, and and found something that Tucker Carlson said once.  And then, once again the socialist becomes \"the forgotten man\". \n\n###Why isn't anyone calling me an enemy combatant and taking me to Gitmo?  Don't I matter?\"\n\n\nSo yes, I believe socialists really miss Trump, because they had an enemy, and someone who would fight back against them, even if it was mostly him just treating them like spoiled children.  Because literally the worse thing that can happen to someone who claims to be not just fighting the establishment, but destined to win, is for the establishment to completely dismiss and ignore them.\n\n##BUT That's not real socialism\n\nYeah, I don't want to hear it.

This society does the stupidest shit.. \n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to see and comprehend that advocating for cigarettes is doing the complete opposite of advocating for freedom.. yet so many people conveniently don't grasp that part and pat themselves on the back for thinking \"free\".. when they aren't. \n\nAdvocating for freedom to become addicted to a government backed substance is the opposite of actually being free; you're literally advocating for more drones and robots to addiction. \n\nYou think you're going against the government by crying about them taking away or limiting cigarettes, yet you don't see you're doing the exact thing they want you to do. You think the government actually gives a fuck about prohibiting tobacco? If it didn't make them so much money for decades and generations, they would have by now. That's why it's commonly known that tobacco companies owners and workers have even stated they don't smoke themselves and that it's for the stupid people falling into their addictions and capitalism...\n\nThe government has supported tobacco companies for generations.

They're creating addicts because the more addicts they have, the more money they make; the tobacco companies AND the government. \n\nSo take a second to think and really comprehend what the fuck you're advocating for.. you aren't advocating for real freedom. Real freedom would be NOT being controlled and extorted by the government. You think holding a stupid paper saying how much you advocate tobacco is going against the government.. lol its not. You're doing their jobs for them. We should be advocating that the government actually does something about it; that would help the addiction, the money they extort from our health and it would make the country a better place.. but of course not.

And then they're upvoted for it. Why do people constantly think doing this is funny or cool? Why is actively annoying people so supported? \n\nIt just looks like a lack of individuality and a lack of respect tbh. And then it seems like half of the half of comments that do it are recycling something someone already commented like they couldn't even be bothered enough to actually read them before commenting themselves. Its like the only reason they went to the post was to make that comment, which just shows how hive mindey the place is if everyone is using the same jokes without even knowing. \n\nIf I read or hear that someone dislikes something (especially if they're a stranger and have no issues with them), I'm not going to go out of my way to annoy them with it? What does that do for me but just make me look like an asshole? But again that seems to be the culture that's supported on Reddit.. \n\n\"Oh they don't like it? Ima do it anyway!\" Like it just comes off entitled and privileged. I don't see many people or posts that talk about this so I decided to make one. I originally was going to make a post as to how yo momma jokes are overused and unfunny but then got to thinking let me address the main issue: the lack of originality and individuality in general. There's enough posts about yo momma jokes and every single one of them is bombarded with yo momma jokes. I don't know if it's a maturity issue (seems like there's a lot of immature people on here) or just a lack of respect and decency (which is also a maturity issue) but it does get annoying. \n\nBut it goes beyond this tho. Almost anything you say or post you're going to be bombarded with people trying to argue with you, or trying to nitpick something, or trying to \"call something out\", or just doing something. And I understand; its a public platform and people have their own opinions but people will waste all this time and energy going out of their way to discredit or argue with someone. They never once think \"hmm, maybe my opinion really isn't needed right now\" or \"well honestly I don't have much experience with said thing, maybe my two cents is irrelevant and unnecessary\". But no, majority of the time people feel compelled to have everything they think heard (I don't know if it's an ego issue, a privilege issue, a deflection that they aren't being heard in reality, or what). \n\nAnd people undoubtedly are going to say \"you're doing the same thing.. voicing your opinion\". Yeah I am voicing my opinion on my own post. But there's a difference between making a post to talk about things and simply going out of your way to a post you dislike to state your disapproval. I don't go to posts I dislike. If the post has a title I dislike; I probably won't open it. If I open a post and dislike it; I'm probably just moving on to a post I do like. Honestly I don't even really look at other posts on Reddit often but if I do I try to be respectful. I don't even remember the last time I've downvoted a post. People spend their whole day going around arguing and disliking posts. I don't care enough about your opinions to argue tbh and if I do, I'll specifically make a post asking for your opinions. I know my opinion isn't always needed or wanted, so I don't go sharing them in comment sections, I simply make my own post about it. People really run around putting others down and calling them names (very first comment they make, very first interaction they have with the internet stranger) for no reason other than to just be negative. \n\nLook; if you don't like something, you're more than free to go to a post you like and start a conversation there. But not every single thing, not every single post, not every single person and situation needs your two cents. It's really entitled and privileged to think and assume everyone wants and needs it. Just because you could do something, doesn't mean you should. Just because you could say something, doesn't mean you should say something. People need to learn how to be humble but Reddit is too \"edgy\" for that. \n\nBut ultimately this is my two cents. On my own post. I expect to get peoples opinions back since this is a broad statement. There's a difference between giving your feedback on something like this, where it's open and about more than one thing, and actively going to a rap song when you don't even like or listen to rap, just to down it and call it trash. Not every opinion is needed and beneficial. \n\nAnd back to the title of the post; quit going around ironically commenting and posting things people dislike and don't want just to try looking like that edgy person that doesn't care and wants to bend the rules.

We have accepted slavery and racism within our borders for a long time and now feel very very ashamed. Thus we are in a continuous struggle to make this right and prove to descendants of slaves that we are better now. \n\nIn the meanwhile modern slavery is rampant and nobody bats an eye. Our entire modern civilization is depending on it for cheap and fast consumer goods. The rich 'slave owners' and exploiters happily participate in our society and we pretend everything is different now. \n\nIn Qatar this year the most popular sporting event will be held. It is quite literally built on the dead bodies of modern slaves who had to build these stadiums under horrible circumstances. \n\nWe have accepted modern colonizing endeavours for influence expansion like the war in Iraq. We've supported and\/or facilitated many coups in middle and south America, with a recent one being Bolivia for lithium. When a war(aka peace mission) is deemed not beneficial for the West we just leave, even if the people in the are of the war are not much safer (Afghanistan,  Iraq). \n\nWhen other countries wage a war we decide to participate only for strategic reasons. That's why Israel can do what it wants in Palestine. Russia's interference in Georgia was unanswered with public outcry but when they did the same to Ukraine (strategically important for many reasons) we're super angry.\n\nWe dont care about slavery. We care that the descendants of slavery in our own countries have become vocal about it. But together with those descendants we are consuming the fruits of modern slavery and expansion drifts as if nothing is going on. \n\nWhat we are upset about is decided by how big the impact of  changing it would be on our own lives. So rather than solving the very real and very actual problems, like modern slavery and climate change, we choose to spend much more time on how we treated people in the past. Because saying you're outraged and ashamed is much easier than fighting the things that make our lives so easy. \n\nWe will go down in history as savages, just like our slave owner ancestors.","332":"Not really a proper opinion but an opinion nonetheless but I just wanna give a shoutout to this sub.

I think there are plenty of steps one could have taken before it having to come to abortion. \n\nMany women use the argument \"it's my body so it's my choice\". But it's not only your body, it's also the body of your unborn child that is effected. Both your rights and that of your unborn baby should be taken into account when making this decision and I think when making such a decision the right of the (unborn) child to live should carry more weight. \n\nBut you are not ready to have a baby? Maybe you should have thought of that beforehand! Use condoms and other forms of birth control. And yes, I am aware that there is still a residual chance of both the condom and birth control failing. And that's a risk you can either accept, or you should avoid having heterosexual intercourse all together. And I don't mean this as an argument against sex. I mean that so many things in life carry risks that we can only accept. When we get in our car or on our bike, we have a chance that we die in a traffic accident. Just as much as having sex means there is a risk that 9 months later, a little miracle will happen. \n\nAlso, I think any decision on what the maximum period to have an abortion is, is completely arbitrary. What is the difference between say 6 weeks or 6 months? Or 6 months vs 9 months? Why does a baby that is almost fully grown have more right to live than a baby that's just conceived? \n\nPlus, I think people should really take more consideration at the option of adoption. Anonymous if you have to.  An argument I often hear against that is that adopted children have a higher chance of becoming a dropout or a criminal and those are sad statistics. But at least those children got a chance to do something better with their lives and there are plenty of stories out there of people who grew up without their parents and who still did something great with their life!\n\nI admit there are situations like when rape was involved, or when the life of the mother is in danger that are ethically more challenging and I could certainly understand if we keep special exceptions for those situations.

Have I been fooled again? There was no Holocaust?\n\nLet me think about this for a bit\u2026.yeah, sounds good. If there was no Holocaust, I can go back to blaming George Soros for all the things I don\u2019t like. Moreover, I can add all \u201cJews\u201d as a stand in for Soros.

And, there are lots of other people in my town that I have never felt comfortable about too. Some of them are men who have sex with men, some of them speak Arabic and some Spanish. Yuck. \n\nBut guess what?

Tibet separatist movement  does not have any broad support, and is a fringe movement of wholesum  religious extremists. Tibet does not have a big population, and it would  decrease further after succession, and would struggle to fight back or  even just use its resources effectively.

If you are an American  basketball player or a Hollywood star, supporting this cause means you  either believe your own country is a utopia and there are no problems  with it currently, or (more likely) you deliberately chose a cause so  distant and impractical to appear radical without doing jack, then got  offended that another country can use tools to ensure its national interests. Practical implementation of Free Tibet would largely  distabilise, militarise and further turn Asia and the world away from  democracy.

NOT ALL women choose partners based on looks, some do but, the statement is still false. The argument I hear a lot from guys who DM me is \u201cwomen only want a 6\u2019 Chad\u201d; when I tell them it is simply not true they ignore it & move straight to insults. The reason I know this is not true is because I am married to a man who is not 6 feet tall. My sister is dating a man who isn\u2019t 6 feet tall. Plenty of other women are living proof that a man doesn\u2019t have to be ridiculously tall to get a girlfriend.\n\nNow back to the Black Pill argument, not all women choose sexual partners based only on looks. Also, \u201clooks\u201d is very subjective, one woman can find a person attractive, and another can think they are unattractive. Yes, looks matter. But it\u2019s an unsound inference to go from this experiment to the conclusion that \u201call women judge all men primarily and forever on the basis of their appearance\u201d. I don't think these men are as ugly as they claim they are, it's just a way to keep this blackpill-narrative and blame women instead of taking a hard look at the mirror and see how much time they've wasted on this instead of growing as a person. If they think women, 51.1% of world population, are personally against them, maybe the problem isn't women. Growing just needs to happen outside of the comfort-zone.

This is a divisive ideology which creates tension between friend groups, makes children suspicious of one another, and is only a THEORY as to explain the inter-group dynamics in this country. It involves taking every claim of oppression at its word and deferring to individuals' view of their own oppression rather than assessing data to assess whether the claim is actually true... and taught to young, impressionable children. \n\nAnyone who is opposed to this is told they \"oppose teaching American history.\" They are painting opposition to something extreme as opposition to something reasonable, to make it look like the other side is simply against teaching history and is heavily invested in maintaining racism. They do this to sneak extreme elements into the curriculum. This is not true. I learned American history in schools and about its atrocities. I learned about the Slave Trade, the Civil Rights movement, the Trail of Tears... I understood at a young age that these things were wrong and that as a society we need to treat one another with kindness and move forward. That is not what they are pushing for now, which is a very dulled-down version of CRT which teaches that the system is irredeemable and certain demographics are \"oppressors.\" \n\nExample 2: The Florida parental rights in education bill.\n\nThe Left is suggesting that this bill is designed to \"prevent students from knowing that LGBTQ+ people exist\" and that the goal is to prevent children from discussing their families, and \"to prevent against teaching LGBTQ+ history\" (here we go with history again)! \n\nIn reality, this bill is designed to prevent incidents such as this ([https:\/\/www.news-press.com\/story\/news\/education\/2022\/05\/05\/cape-coral-florida-teacher-casey-scott-fired-discussion-sexual-orientation-pansexual-lgbtq-flags\/9649148002\/](https:\/\/www.news-press.com\/story\/news\/education\/2022\/05\/05\/cape-coral-florida-teacher-casey-scott-fired-discussion-sexual-orientation-pansexual-lgbtq-flags\/9649148002\/)).\n\nThis teacher claims that students asked her questions about her sexual orientation, she answered that she was pansexual, explained what that meant, and then gave an assignment for the students for their next art project which involved designing a pride flag for their own sexual orientation, which was subsequently hung on the wall. This teacher not only told students who and what she is attracted to, which is entirely inappropriate, but encouraged them to reveal their own sexual orientation in a way that she, the entire class, and the entire school would know about it. IT IS ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR ADULTS TO DISCUSS THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION WITH CHILDREN.\n\nOther examples include teachers telling kindergarteners that they \"don't need to pick their gender yet\" and telling them that the American flag is a symbol of imperialism and forcing them to pledge allegiance to the LGBTQ+ flag instead. \n\nBut opposition to this bill is painted as \"being against acknowledging that LGBTQ+ people exist.\"","384":"I think this would get me flamed but I really hate how our culture has made bars and restaurants the default dating place for singles.

Yeah, it sucks that there's no magical objective 'ought'. We SHOULD have the right to be free. But doesn't mean we will always have this 'right'.

But the argument can't be 'it's a right' when it longer is. That just doesn't make sense.\n\nPeople mistake my view that it's not a right as in 'so you think it's ok to own slaves?'

People say \"Oh you have extra intelligence\/empathy, that's always a good thing!\" No it isn't. You don't understand. Extra intelligence comes with tons of problems: perfectionism, pressure from family, hidden mental issues like ADHD. Too much empathy can make people lose sleep worrying about people all the way on the other side of the globe. Too much empathy can lead you to cling to those who leech off your care and give you nothing in return out of the urge to \"fix their lives.\"\n\nI wrote this because I personally know someone who fits the definition of \"empath.\" Hearing about someone else's hardship makes her feel severely depressed. Hearing any bad news causes her to lose sleep worrying about people she doesn't even know. She also has a sort of urge to \"fix the person's life,\" and it crushes her when she can only help to a point (e.g. suggesting therapy to someone who doesn't want it). She avoids almost all social contact because she is worried someone will casually drop that their spouse was abusive, or their brother is in jail, or their friend died in a car crash. She tries to avoid the news, but sometimes gives in to the urge to go on the internet. She knows she can't just fix everyone's life, but she cannot control what she feels.\n\n(I know she needs therapy, but she won't go because she doesn't think it will help. She says she is perfectly fine with her hermit life. I can't force her to go, but I do my best to help and support her.)\n\nIt makes me furious that my friend's stress, and worry, and depression, and sleepless nights are being discounted because close-minded and ignorant people think \"extra empathy can only be a good thing!\"","397":"[deleted]","398":"[removed]","399":"With the recent Supreme Court leak in regards to Roe v Wade (which was in itself a politically motivated undermining of that storied institution) we have seen leftists and Democrats coming out of the woodwork to question and delegitimize the authority of the Supreme Court of the United States. As the Supreme Court is one of the three pillars upon which the government of the United States is built, any effort to delegitimize or question the authority of that branch can be interpreted as nothing short of an attack on democracy and the very foundation of this nation. Democratic politicians are threatening to pack the court with their obedient stooges, while protests in front of the court building have already turned violent. Even further, we have fringe leftist radicals threatening to dox Justices and MUCH worse. Apparently, all of the bellowing about \"threats to democracy\" after Jan 6th was just hot air, because it seems to be clear that the left and Democrats have no issues whatsoever in attempting to dismantle and delegitimize the very foundations of our government when they don't get their way.

I'm also very big on taking responsibility for your actions, which would normally put me towards the pro life side, with an exception for rape, as I and most people could not conscionably force a rape victim to carry it to term.\n\nWhere I diverge is what I expect reality would be if we banned abortions with a rape exception. I have a pretty bleak view of human nature, and don't see this as a stretch in the slightest. Consider the following.\n\nA woman has voluntary sex and becomes pregnant. She wishes to abort. She then goes to a doctor, lies and says she was raped and is pregnant with a rape baby. We now have 2 possible scenarios.\n\nScenario 1. Take her word for it with nothing further and grant the abortion. If all it takes is a quick lie, I have no doubt virtually every abortion seeking woman would do so without hesitation, and the ban would be utterly ineffective.\n\nScenario 2. Who's the rapist? Report him to the police and press charges. Of course there is no rapist here, but she's desperate to get an abortion, so she'll accuse an innocent man. Not every woman would do this, maybe not even most, but there are nearly 900k abortions per year. If even 10% of women did this then that's 90k innocent men being charged, likely losing their jobs, paying thousands in legal fees, the stress, the stigma for the rest of their lives. And that's if they're not convicted. It's also billions of taxpayer money to fund these prosecutions, plus clogging up the justice system even more making things take even longer. Meanwhile the woman has gotten the abortion, because you can't wait for a year until the outcome of the trial to do it.\n\nThat's my thoughts on the matter, unpopular on the right because pro choice, unpopular on the left because women lie about rape.","401":"Freedom is a very powerful word, and it's included in the constitution of every single democratic country in the world. Freedom is seen in literature and media as the ultimate value and goal of everything. If you don't have freedom, do you have anything at all?\n\nHowever, does anyone really want a \"radical\" freedom? Let's look at some aspects of freedom.\n\n1. In the Soviet Union, during the reign of Stalin, the Soviet constitution stated, that it supports a multiparty system, and that if a group of people wanted to create a party, the state would support that. Reality, however, is *a bit* different. You have the freedom on paper, but not in practice.\n\n2. Radical freedom means to be free of the consequences of your actions. I technically have the freedom to go and slap my boss right now. But the consequences of that action are so punishing, that it's not real freedom is it. To be really free in that sense, would be to be free of the consequences of my actions. For an individual person in a vacuum, it's kinda cool to not face consequences. But do you want to live in a word, where *anyone* is free from consequences of their actions?\n\n3. Freedom often has rules. Think of driving a car. You're free to go wherever you want. But there are rules, such as driving on the right side of the lane, speed limits, traffic lights, areas where overtaking is not allowed, etc. Would you have more individual freedom if those rules were lifted? Yes. But it would have a disasterous effect on society as a whole.\n\n4. Freedom of speech. Truly a great thing. But what if the person exercising their freedom of speech is trying to gather support for a dictatorial and genocidal coup? Or just a regular genocide, where he wants to get rid of anyone belonging to group X. By granting that person their freedom of speech, we actually remove freedoms of people belonging to group X.\n\n5. Hypocrisy. In some states, the same republicans that preach the importance of freedom of speech, are banning school books containing \"uncomfortable\" topics. Clearly they too realize, that radical freedom is not a good thing.\n\n6. One or the other freedom. Some will argue that \"these days you can't say anything\", let's say about gay people. However, back in the early 2000s, unless you were in an extremely liberal metropolis, you couldn't talk about being gay. Something being \"gay\" was used as an insult. There was even a joke tweet about how wearing jeans that fit would get you labeled as a metrosexual. A gay person couldn't just come out. Compare to now, where apparently you can't be critical of gay people. If you had to choose between the freedom of being yourself, or freedom of speech, which one would you chose?\n\n7. A lot of people who are complaining about freedom of speech on reddit, are just complaining of being downvoted. This is a reaction of the community. If you meet with a group of friends and start talking shit about one of their partners, you will get backlash. Similarly, if reddit deletes your comment, you might feel like your freedom of speech is restricted. But imagine you go to a Magic the Gatheric game store and start talking about how magic the gathering sucks or even \"MTG is for cunts\". You'd get thrown out. There are absolutely time and place to talk about MTG, you can even say you don't like the game, or even better you can discuss the limitations of the game, and how it has changed during the years. My point is, there are constructive ways to express opinions, and there appropriate places to express opinions, and there always have been rules about how and what and when we should talk about.\n\nTL;DR: We never had radical freedom, and never will. And we're better off for it.","402":"[deleted]","403":"[deleted]","404":"I'm fairly new on Reddit but I discovered that I get downvoted for posts that are not offensive, rude or oponionated in a toxic way.\n\nI understand this made up rule wouldn't make sense on all subs (e.g. AITA) but definitely could be tried on r\/AskReddit.\n\nI'm not being childish - I simply want yo understand if I offended someone and how to prevent similar comments in the future or to apologise.","405":"[deleted]","406":"Abortion is one of the biggest get out of responsibility free cards you can play, right up there with bankruptcy. If you take that away from society that would spell the end of the heterosexual hookup culture. Far less women would go out to bars and clubs. Far less std's and unplanned pregnancies because far less sex. Or when there is sex people would be far more likely to use condoms. Less pregnancies means less people and the planet would be saved. Overpopulation is a huge issue nobody talks about. Too many kids born into wedlock to single moms and a life of poverty and no hope.","407":"[deleted]","408":"[deleted]","409":"For starters, my own stances on abortion are mixed. I think making it illegal won't make it go away, but I also think it's an extremely selfish decision, if your life isn't on the line. However, I 100% do not respect parents who support aborting a baby for non life threatening reasons!!!\n\nWhy? Imagine having a child, holding that child in your arms, watching that child grow up and slowly learn about the world. In those moments, the love you have for you child, is something that no one can describe with words alone. \n\nNow Imagine, taking that bond, that love, those memories, and imagine it being taken away because you were scared. All those moments you treasured, those bonds, that special feeling of love you have for your child, just...gone\n\nWhat kind of human being without a conscience would support the idea of taking a child's life away, just because \"you may not be ready\" for the task?\n\nIf you've never had a child, I'd be more sympathetic and understanding. But knowing what you'd be taking away from a baby, and still supporting it? Absolutely not! That would be like texting while driving, after losing a loved one to reckless driving. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong. What do you think?","410":"Abortion shouldn't have been legal to begin with. I guess degenerates can't go around sleeping with whoever they want unprotected and have no consequence.\n\nWrap it before ya tap it.

The longer you wait, the less believable you are and unless you are a sick nasty lying POS, then you know you are in the right. The sooner you report a rape the sooner that person can STOP raping other people as well. You may not like to hear this but you are being selfish by keeping it to yourself and not contacting the authorities. If you don\u2019t contact police and let it be, then the rapist will feel they have gotten away with it and do it again and is free go to rape more people. If you report then they go to jail and you don\u2019t have to worry about them anymore. It just boggles my mind when I see groups of victims claiming they\u2019ve been raped 15+ years ago, like why didn\u2019t you say anything before? You could\u2019ve prevented all the rape victims after you.\n\nEdit: you should report this immediately just like you would any other crime, an accident, break in, etc. why does rape have to be different unless they are hiding something. And I\u2019m not accusing anybody of anything but it makes you look not genuine if you wait so long to report","414":"\\*By anti-abortionists, I mean people who're pro-banning-abortion.\n\nIt is obvious and has been shown countless times that restricting abortion does nothing to lower abortion rates. Here's a couple sources: ([1](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/search\/research-news\/3415\/)) ([2](https:\/\/www.colorado.edu\/asmagazine\/2021\/09\/22\/study-shows-abortion-ban-may-lead-21-increase-pregnancy-related-deaths)) ([3](https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/think\/opinion\/abortion-rates-don-t-drop-when-procedure-outlawed-it-does-ncna1235174)).\n\nTherefore, by restricting access to safe abortions, anti-abortionism is driving safe abortions in medical settings underground into shady unsafe back alleys, which is causing more deaths than the 'babies' it is supposedly saving. Hundreds of women died in unsafe abortions before Roe v Wade ([4](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/2019\/05\/29\/planned-parenthoods-false-stat-thousands-women-died-every-year-before-roe\/)).\n\nIn fact, abortion rates are actually higher in high-income countries that restrict abortion compared to high-income countries that don't restrict abortions ([5](https:\/\/www.guttmacher.org\/fact-sheet\/induced-abortion-worldwide)). The only meaningful way to actually reduce abortions is by expanding access to contraceptives and sex education ([6](https:\/\/www.guttmacher.org\/report\/adding-it-up-investing-in-sexual-reproductive-health-2019)).\n\nBanning abortion also creates a hostile environment for women who miscarried, such as in this case ([7](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2022\/apr\/10\/texas-woman-murder-charges-dropped-self-induced-abortion)).\n\nStop calling anti-abortionists pro-life and start calling them pro-forced-birth or pro-sexual-control. Actual pro-lifers should be helping women get safe abortions and promoting the use of birth control and contraceptives.","415":"\"but what if the PHONE COMPANY could tell you what you can and can't say!!!\" is genuinely one of the dumbest arguments you can make. \n\nThe phone company is a natural monopoly.

Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and every other social media site out there has many, many competitors that you may switch to.\n\nYou are not entitled to someone else's private property.","416":" \n\nEveryone knows that employment at-will is the concept that employer or employee  can terminate employment at anytime for any reason, including no reason  at all.\n\nI think that needs to be modified, because this is harmful to employees.\n\nFirst off, verbal-written-termination should be the universal disciplinary norm.\n\nWhat  I am suggesting: If an employer feels it is necessary to terminate an  employee, documentation needs to be provided. Examples:\n\n1. If  an employer wants to fire an employee for wearing a red shirt, the  employer needs to cite their company handbook that forbids red shirts  and document said employee wearing red shirt. Document verbal, written  warnings regarding wearing of red shirt.\n2. If  an employer feels the need to take away the jobs of other employees for  economic reasons, document projected P&L showing how financial  situation will improve ONLY by taking away jobs. It's stupid to lay off  people because you're not doing well; that's like saving gas by removing  half your engine. Doesn't make sense.\n3. If  an employer wants to pull some vague BS like \"employee wasn't working  out\" or \"employee wasn't growing into the role,\" document it and prove  it. You can't just hide behind a vague phrase like that, it's cowardly  and unprofessional.\n\nAll  terminations will be reviewed by the same respective office that handles unemployment (usually the state's respective Department of Labor or equivalent). During the state's termination review, the employee should be paid full wages in Unemployment. If the state rejects the company's  termination (i.e. doesn't think there's sufficient reason\/evidence), the employee is reinstated. If not, the termination stands, and the  employee is paid full-wage unemployment, but decreases by 2% each week  until it's run out.\n\nExample: Employee is paid $1,000 a week\n\nWeek 1 of unemployment: $1,000\n\nWeek 2 \" \": $980\n\nWeek 3 \" \": $960\n\netc until he finds a job.","417":"I do not understand the hype.

Individual rights shouldn't be subject to a vote. The Nazi's rose to power through the democratic process, and Jim Crow was established under democracy. What is popular isn't necessarily what is right. Another problem with democracy has to do with IQ. Many people aren't capable of making informed political choices and they can be easily swayed by politicians. The US isn't even supposed to be a democracy, and democracy wasn't mentioned in the constitution. A republic with strong protections for individual rights is preferable and is what the founders intended.","419":"I'm really sick of this word.

When I say religious, I mean \u201cman\u2019s interpretation of the world around them.\u201d\n\nThose who fanaticize science as a belief are just as overbearing, unscientific, and annoying as religious zealots. \n\nPretty much all science is fallible. Scientific \u201cfacts\u201d of 50 years ago, or even 5 years ago, change constantly. Things we believe to be facts today are not facts tomorrow.\n\nPutting all of your faith in scientific fact is, in my opinion, just as \u201cbaseless\u201d as putting your faith in a Creator, and for this reason - you have to be just as \u201creligious\u201d to be an atheist as you have to be \u201creligious\u201d to believe in a God.\n\nYour own religion is what you make of the world around you essentially - and how it came to be. You have to put *faith* in an idea, an opinion on how things came to be.  \n\nTo put it simply, staunch atheists are just as religious as staunch Christians, Muslims, etc.\n\nEvidence is based on what? Another man\u2019s opinion or perspective. You must literally put faith in other men\u2019s observations.\n\nEven then, humans are faulty. We constantly make mistakes. Many things that were believed by everybody about science in the 40\u2019s have been found to be completely untrue. Just because it was \u201cscience\u201d back then, doesn\u2019t mean it is true.

I\u2019m just saying that it is verifiably very possible for a little or a lot of it to be faulty or downright false.

But I have a different definition of it than most people do. For me, pro-choice isn't strictly about abortion. Abortion is a big part of it, but once you make it safely out of your mother's womb, you're no longer dependent on someone else's body to keep you alive, and therefore it most definitely is \"your body, your choice\", which I am a firm believer in.\n\n\"My body, my choice\" means a lot of things. It means not being forced to undergo any body modifications, like circumcision, piercings, tattoos, etc. (I'm not against those procedures themselves, they just shouldn't be forced upon anyone, especially young children). It also means that children shouldn't be forced to undergo any medical procedures, therapy, etc. without a significant amount of input. They shouldn't be forced to go to therapy for problems they don't actually have, and if they do need to go to therapy, the therapist should listen, ask questions, and take into consideration what the child is saying. The parents would of course still have to sign off on everything, but the therapist should be able to say \"Your child has made it very clear that they do not want to do x, y, and z because it makes them uncomfortable, and I don't think it's in their best interest to force them to do it. You are the parents, but your child is their own person, therefore they should have a say in what happens to them.\"\n\nAnother thing is that pro-choice to me means pro-life, pro-death, and the ability to choose between the two. If a woman chooses to have a baby, that is her choice. But if a person wishes to die for whatever reason, and it can be proven that it's their decision and they haven't been coerced, they should be allowed to do so.\n\nNow, here's the loophole. Many of the people who support the pro-choice movement are also very adamant that people should get vaccinated for COVID. I am vaccinated, so are my parents, and I'm very glad they chose to do so. My family is pretty liberal (I wouldn't say that we're far-left extremists, but we're left-of-center), yet they said that, while they encourage people to get the vaccine, ultimately it is their body and their choice. If they don't want to get the vaccine, they shouldn't be forced to get it. Again, my body, my choice.\n\nTo summarize everything, people who say they believe in \"my body, my choice\" but also support vaccine mandates are hypocrites.","424":"If they had acquired nukes then we would have a North Korea and Pakistan situation.

If a population is in equilibrium, having children is gambling people's lives just so you can have a family. \n\nWith mental health, genetics, and general randomness from life, you could birth a child that lives in hell regardless of how a person is raised or their environment. The outcome of the child is mostly luck. The child could grow up to kill themselves and the parent would be 100% to blame. They had the child just so they could have a family of blood relatives when they could've simply adopted. No one chooses to live and birth is forcing life on someone. \n\nHaving a kid is one of the most selfish and fucked up things one can do. If you had a kid and they happen to be perfectly fine, cool but your lucky you didn't create a person to live in pain.

Now, there's one thing I do take issue with. It's that the culture and aesthetic, remaining virtually unchanged from 1955 until 2077, is extremely unrealistic. We all know that culture, as well as architecture, can and will change, and rapidly in an industrialized world. Just look at how everything changed from 1860 to 1890, or 1900 to 1930. You mean to tell me, that when it comes to culture, architecture, clothing, and many other things, it remained completely stagnant for over 120 years?\n\nI get that lore wise the transistor and microprocessor weren't invented until way later on down the road, but I offer a counterargument, there were no microprocessors or transistors in the 1800s, yet architecture, culture, and clothing all changed drastically over the course of that century. Just look at how men dressed in the year 1800 and how they dressed in 1899, it's a stark difference. Yet the Fallout universe expects us to believe that people in up until 2077, would build, dress, talk, and have the same culture the exact same way it was in 1955? I honestly think that it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.","428":"Many here seem to think that women mog the shit out of men since women have a way higher sexual market value than men. But the truth is the exact opposite for the exact same reason. Since women are picky about who they want to have sex with, there is far more selection pressure on men to look attractive vs women.\n\nPeople will usually object to what I've said by saying, but women look prettier or \"only chad mogs women but most women mog the average man.\" You think women look prettier because you are a straight man not because women are actually more aesthetic. And the average man does mog the fuck out of an average woman since for his genes to even exist, the men in his genealogy had to be chads while the women only had to have a pulse.\n\nPlus look at other animals. Even ugly male peacocks mogs a female peacocks because of how colourful and elegant a male peacock is... We see the same thing in mammals. Male lions that look subhuman compared to other males still mog female lions because of their elegant manes and more muscular bodies.\n\nEven in humans, men are taller, broader, and more muscular. Our faces are more angular, our eyes are more piercing because they're deeper set. Our jaws are more chiseled and defined. We're also the more hairy sex which is actually a halo. If you want an unbiased opinion compare animals with hair compared to hairless animals.

No one should ever be shamed or condemned because of their genital preferences for sexual partners or ANY other type of criteria they have for choosing their sexual partners.

In spite of 'retard' being a term used for the mentally disabled, the same people that cry over 'faggot' will suddenly rush to defend the use of the word 'retard'.\n\nAll of a sudden, all that nuance they place on the word 'fag\/faggot\/gay' immediately disappears the moment you're using a term to refer to the disabled. So now you're telling me that this sick and twisted term can perfectly apply to any given context without dehumanizing the disabled? All of a sudden retard doesn't inherently mean 'you're dumb because you're disabled, and being disabled is wrong'? Are you kidding me?\n\nHere's the real truth, both words are inherently wrong, but because gay people have a voice, look like us, talk like us, work like us,etc. YOU became inclined to brush off every single insult that could be related to them.  \nBut disabled people don't have a voice, they can't do many of the things 'normal' people do.

You;re basically looking at your data page by page, hitting the down button or scroll bar and then waiting and waiting for it to load like poor some kid in the early 90s with a 2400 baud modem\n\nIf these pages weren't annoying enough, they have also turned the End key into the most useless key on the keyboard - it is effectively now just another PgDn, which was a pathetic key anyway since you can just use the down arrow or scroll bar to do the same thing.  PgDn is so irrelevant that they never even put it on the same place in a laptop keyboard, but End is now even less useful.\n\nWhat I am proposing is simple - the End key should do what it says on the label, which is take you to the end of the web page. So for infinitely scrolling web pages, which have no end, they should just continue to load data until there is nothing left to load, or until you've exhausted every scrap of RAM and hard drive space your system can find, compressing all of your old data if necessary, or maybe just deleting it if you have a recent backup.\n\nI understand that people may complain when there is no way to abort this procedure so I would also propose a pop-up confirmation that comes up the first time you use the End key on an infinitely scrolling web page that says something like:\n\n###You have just pressed the End key which is the most powerful key on the keyboard.  This is your one and only warning.  We are not fucking around here.  \n\nThen we would show a clip of Will Smith smacking Chris Rock at the Oscars just to show that shit is, indeed, real.\n\nAnd then, from that point on, the End key will operate the way that it was always designed to, which means that on an infinitely scrolling web page, your computer will load all of the data available or die trying, and will rightfully respond with angry beeps if you hit Esc or try to close the browser window, just to make it .clear how much power the End key now wields.","442":"First of, I believe we evolved as ovnivores, we should get our nutrition from all sources to be healthy, a plant only diet can be done but you must be very disciplined, monitor your diet really closely (and in some cases take supplements) or you risk being malnourished or have other health problems.\n\nNow, every now and then when I see a discussion about food there's that guy with their moral high ground claiming we don't need to eat animals, and because of that is immoral to inflict distress and suffering to said animals, destroy ecosystems to make grounds for raising them for human consumption, and generally harming the environment more than we need to.\n\nAnd there is some validity to these claims, however if they are really that worried about animals and the planet, and want to live a life style that is less harmful and sustainable, they should start eating insects as a core part of their diets.\n\nInsects are insanely easy to breed, they have a really high protein content per gram, they need less space and resources, they are all around the best choice as a sustainable food source.\n\nAnd if you my friend are concerned about insect suffering, you're far too gone, are you concerned about that mosquito you just smacked?, Or that cockroach you stomped with your foot?.\n\nThe only reason reason people don't like it is because cultural conditioning, where I'm from people eat some species of grasshoppers and ants, cocked or grounded as ingredients for other dishes and it's normal.\n\nSo hey you vegan!, Start eating insects and save the planet!","443":"If you use anonymity software. i.e. tor (software used to enter the deep\/dark web) and Tails OS (a portable operating system that protects against surveillance and censorship) all the times thats mean you have something wrong\/illegal to hide \nBut in the same time if you post your life online with all the details (i.e. address, face, phone number, frequent place you go to like some cafe) this is worse because not only government can get you easily but also thieves, gold diggers, hate criminals have some useful and accurate informations to locate AND THIS INFORMATION IS UNDELETABLE they may restore it by some web crawlers (google hidden pages) and individual data holders r\/DataHoarder.","444":"The marketplace of ideas is the notion that the good ideas will dominate in a sea of competing ideas. It sounds good in theory, but this makes the flawed assumption that the majority of humans act rationally and in good faith, when this is not true. People have biases and emotions that cause them to ignore reason. Furthermore, many topics are inherently complicated; people may not always be willing to listen to the nuances of a topic or they may not even be capable of understanding them.  Because of this, it's not necessarily true that the best ideas will dominate in a marketplace of ideas.\n\nFor a platform to successfully implement a marketplace of ideas, its users have to be capable of rational thought and willing to prioritize rational thought when contributing to the marketplace. The former of these two is relatively easy to implement. By making some sort of intellectual puzzle or test a requirement to creating an account, you can weed out people who are incapable of higher-order thought. These tests should also present themselves randomly from time to time while someone is using the platform in order to mitigate cheaters who have someone else help them make an account. If the test is not completed in time or the person performs poorly, their account should be locked for some time. Repeated failures to complete these tests should result in a ban, with the opportunity for an appeal. This is not a perfect solution, but I think it will really minimize the number and impact of irrational individuals on a platform, ensuring that the majority of users are people capable of reason and logic.\n\nThe other problem, that the majority of users must be willing to prioritize reason is much harder to solve. Intelligent people often resort to irrational arguments out of their desire to promote an agenda. If the majority of users on a platform are like this, you're not really going to have a marketplace of ideas. It may sound unlikely that the majority of people on a platform are just going to be agenda pushers, but I'd argue that this isn't the case at all. The people who are most vested in a platform to share ideas are the people who want to push agendas. They will be the ones most likely to participate in this sort of thing as well as the ones who will spend the most time participating. People without an agenda are probably not going to participate as much. The only potential solution that I can think of is some level of content moderation, but this runs the risk of leading to censorship, which ruins the whole idea of a free marketplace. If anyone can think of other potential solutions to this problem, please mention it.\n\nEven if we don't have a solution to the second problem, I think any platform that solves the first problem will be much closer to achieving a marketplace of ideas than any other platform that exists. Weed out the people who can't understand reason and you'll have one less problem to worry about.","445":"[removed]","446":" Basically what the title says, so pretty self explanatory.

They often point to things like affirmative actions and use this as a basis for making the argument that white people are less privileged.\n\nHowever, this ignores the fact that such programs are only put in place to compensate for a disadvantage that already exists. For example, if someone has bad eyesight and they therefore get glasses, this isn't discriminatory against those with good eyesight. The same principles applies to affirmative action.\n\nWhite people experience life from a privileged perspective, but they often fail to realize this, because the privilege is invisible to those who experience it - the privilege they receive is not being held back or discriminated against for their race in any way. Since this privilege is the absence of something rather than the presence of something, it could not be perceived without knowing what was absent. But since white people do not experience life from the perspective of a Black person, they do not realize the extent to which they face discrimination, and therefore, as white people, do not appreciate the fact of not experiencing said discrimination.","452":"I recently read an [article](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) that proves that it is really easy to cure cancer and th eonly reason it's not being distributed is because it will kill the profits of Big Pharma.

New technology might *lessen some* effects, but it would likely *increase other* negative effects on society (that may or may not be climate-related). Being more environmentally conscious would delay it, but it's only a matter of time before that doesn't work. And even if individuals are more environmentally conscious, big companies, which do just as much damage if not more, will never be held accountable because people in power are greedy.\n\nPlus, you can't get all of society to do one thing, it's futile. The pandemic has proved this. People are far more divided now than they ever have been. People won't wear a face covering to keep themselves or others from dying, either because they don't understand or they don't care. Getting everyone to use clean energy, take public transport, etc. won't work, especially since some people live in areas where these options are unaffordable or near impossible to achieve.\n\nIf anything, we should be preparing FOR climate change rather than whining about how we can't stop it. We might be able to create facilities that can withstand extreme heat\/water and stay cool and dry inside. With our new medical knowledge and technology, we might be able to develop vaccines\/antibiotics for the ancient deadly diseases that could plague us. Stuff like that. But even that stuff would probably become futile after a while.\n\nIt is likely that climate change is a natural event that has been greatly increased by human activity, meaning it would eventually be inevitable no matter how hard we try. I DO NOT DENY THE YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT PROVE THE EARTH'S TEMPERATURE BEGAN RISING MUCH MORE QUICKLY AT THE START OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. I am offering up the possibility that while human activity has GREATLY SPED UP the Earth's temperature, that the rising may be something that would naturally happen eventually, just not for thousands\/millions\/billions? more years. Why do I think this? Probably because the existence of an Ice Age indicates the existence of another extreme, a \"heat age.\" Anyways, humans are very intelligent, but we are not entirely above nature and natural processes. Eventually, humanity will run its course somehow. We can try to delay it, but it is inevitable. And I have a feeling the Earth will recover okay if\/when humanity is wiped off it. As George Carlin says, \"The planet is fine. The PEOPLE are fucked.\"\n\nWe have this superficial desire to build up society as much as possible, while avoiding the fact that these advancements will most likely lead to our demise. The pattern is seen again and again throughout history, yet we cannot learn from it. But then again, what else are we to do? We are only human. Inventing technology, advancing society, etc. seems to sort of be what humans do. You would think that our ability to be aware of the effects of our behaviors would lead us to do something about it, but a lot of us are so caught up in our own lives that we don't bother. In a way, that makes us sort of animalistic. We are still animals, still a part of nature. The evidence of this is stronger now than it ever has been.\n\nIn the end, the net negative is that humans will no longer exist. In the greater scheme of things, this changes almost nothing. Perhaps there will be missed opportunity, but again, that is looking at it from a human's perspective, not a universal perspective.\n\nFrom a universal perspective, we are pretty small and insignificant.\n\nShit, that was a trip.

Think about it for a moment, why would any advanced civilization want the recources of a backward society? It makes no sense for a civilization that can harness the energy of a sun and replicate any object to take someone elses resources.

I have always noticed that when people show pride for gun ownership, they often also show support for law enforcement. Which I find odd. Seeing as how if the laws for gun ownership are to keep getting increasingly stringent, we may find ourselves criminals overnight. All because some politician decided to sign a bill into law that now makes a particular weapon or accessory illegal. If and when this happens, does anybody really think the Police will risk their pension and livelihood on the belief that said law is unconstitutional? I think not. I think that if given a seemingly lawfully order from an officers superiors, he\/she would not hesitate to confiscate the now illegal firearm\/accessory. I truly believe that when it comes down to it, in regards to firearm ownership, the police are not your friends.","475":"Not sure how many are familiar with the tragic story of Amy Winehouse - but the gist of it is that barely anyone cared about her well being, not her agents and even a lot of her family, they just kind of forced her to tour and perform even when she was barely conscious, which ultimately led to her death, because they were greedy assholes that just cared about money and having an icon. You can probably find the video of her last ever performance less than a week before her passing, I've seen it and it's pretty morbid.\n\nSo yeah you probably know where I'm going with this. Given JB's condition, it is questionable whether he even *wanted* to run, much less be president - but of course as we all know, given the circumstances and the situation, the pressure to push it was insane and through the roof and he was kind of cornered into a position where he couldn't say \"no I don't want to run\" even if that was the case. But it really does seem a bit worrying how during his speeches with the constant gaffes, it almost seems like he doesn't really want to be there - which is a little sad and depressing and rather morbid when you think about it like that.\n\nSo in a way it does kind of remind me of that situation Amy was in, if that makes sense. I know, sounds crazy and I've never heard anyone make that comparison, but if he does end up passing I have a feeling it will go down in history as one of those morbid elder-abuse scenarios.","476":"Over the last few years, the US has experienced its highest increase in the murder rate in recorded history. Even intellectually bankrupt outlets like CNN admit this:\n\n> https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2021\/10\/06\/health\/us-homicide-rate-increase-nchs-study\/index.html\n\n...with data showing that the murder rate skyrocketed 30% in one year between 2019 and 2020, largely connected to the violent 2020 rampage that swept cities across the US and the \"abolish the police\" rhetoric. Meanwhile, some cities it was particularly horrendous, with Portland having a 250% increase in shootings in September 2020 vs 2019:\n\n> https:\/\/www.koin.com\/news\/crime\/stats-show-dramatic-jump-in-portland-shootings-during-2020\/\n\n...however, many in the mainstream media have marginalized and disregarded this news, only giving it cursory coverage and sidelining discussion on it for the most part. As anyone in the US can attest, the nation's skyrocketing murder rate has NOT been one of the primary topics of discussion within the domain of social media and broadcast talking heads, despite how shocking and disastrous such a development is for the nation and, obviously, for the urban communities that these murders are plaguing.\n\nWhat is truly racist is that the establishment media and social media will not start giving any appreciable coverage and discussion to this subject until it starts affecting white lives. It is only then that people will begin to react and declare that something needs to be done. As long as the victims of these murders are overwhelmingly minorities, the bodies that direct mainstream media discussion will largely ignore this topic because, 1.) they don't care about urban murder within minority communities and 2.) they are afraid that covering it at all will make them look racist. However, you can be sure as sh$t that if hundreds upon hundreds of white kids were getting shot and murdered across American cities every month, there would be round-the-clock coverage, they'd start making new laws named after victims, people would start taking the skyrocketing crime seriously, etc etc. And herein lies the irony, the mainstream media actively ignoring the urban murder out of fear of looking \"racist\" is infinitely more racist than marginalizing it in favor of white victims being murdered. Furthermore, it doesn't help that even activists groups who make their mission focusing on the murders of minorities ignore this issue.\n\nAll murder is equally tragic, no matter WHAT the race of the victim","477":"Men who want to fuck about in their early twenties, fuck about in their late twenties, and then fuck about in their early thirties are pathetic.

There is sound science behind masks and vaccines, but freedom of speech has allowed to people to blatantly lie about these protective measures and led to people demanding the freedom to engage in conduct that harms society. Spreading covid because they won't wear masks, and preventing us from reaching heard immunity because they won't get the vaccine.

[Lyrics](https:\/\/www.songfacts.com\/lyrics\/glenn-frey\/smugglers-blues).  [Video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LSXKyHM133c).  It is forever associated with the TV series Miami Vice as the writer (Micheal Mann) heard the song on the radio during the first season and put both the song and singer in the show.\n\n    The sailors and pilots, the soldiers and the law,\n    The pay offs and the rip offs, and the things nobody saw. \n    No matter if it's heroin,  cocaine, or hash,\n    You've got to carry weapons, cause you always carry cash. \n\nHow are drug crimes actually prosecuted?  As Radley Balko, of Reason magazine writes in his 2010 article [How Drug Cops Go Bad](https:\/\/reason.com\/2011\/03\/21\/how-drug-cops-go-bad), virtually all criminal prosecutions are based upon police informants (who get reduced sentences), or the police themselves setting up the drug deal, potentially manufacturing crime.  (In fact, police prefer to sell drugs rather than buy them, so that they can keep the cash and then sell the same drugs again.)\n\n    There's lots of shady characters,  Lots of dirty deals.\n    Every name's an alias, In case somebody squeals.\n    It's the lure of easy money, It's gotta very strong appeal. \n\nFor this morally dubious behavior, they are rewarded with forfeiture proceeds.  There are many police officers and former police officers who are against the drug war, partly because they have seen its corrupting influence on law enforcement.  But not every drug dealer is willing to get ripped off by police or each other, which is why drug-related homicides account for somewhere between 1\/3 to 1\/2 of all homicides.  Drug users also account for a significant fraction (15-25%) of burglaries.  (Note that different studies define drug-related crime in [different ways](https:\/\/www.ojp.gov\/pdffiles1\/nij\/grants\/246404.pdf)).\n\n    See it in the headlines, you hear it every day.\n    They say they're gonna stop it, but it doesn't go away. \n\n\nCNBC, 2021:  [America has spent over a trillion dollars fighting the war on drugs. 50 years later, drug use in the U.S. is climbing again.](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/06\/17\/the-us-has-spent-over-a-trillion-dollars-fighting-war-on-drugs.html)\n\n> \u201c__We are still in the midst of the most devastating drug epidemic in U.S. history,__\u201d according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, senior fellow at the Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology at Brookings Institution.\n\nWhile lots of people say they are against the drug war, it means absolutely nothing if you vote for the same people who continue it every year.  People who actually put their reputations on the line to help non-violent offenders, like Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, are few and far between, and Trump never received any credit for his First Step Act that freed thousands of non-violent offenders, including [Alice Marie Johnson](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alice_Marie_Johnson).  Ron Paul supporters know the feeling.\n\nThe sad fact is that nobody really cares about drug addicts or drug prisoners - they've been forgotten by both liberals (who abandon old causes just as quickly as they jump onto new ones, and whose issues are now vetted by their corporate backers) and by old-school conservatives (who like certain kinds of big government and authoritarianism and happily ignore that there is no constitutional argument for Federal Drug enforcement).\n\n    It's propping up the governments in Columbia and Peru,\n    You ask any D.E.A. man, He'll say \"There's nothin' we can do\",\n    From the office of the President, Right down to me and you,\n\n\nThe drug war was started by Richard Nixon, but escalated significantly in the 1980s due to the efforts of Senator [Joe Biden](https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2019\/09\/17\/the-untold-story-joe-biden-pushed-ronald-reagan-to-ramp-up-incarceration-not-the-other-way-around\/) who argued that the nation's drug enforcement budget should be equivalent to the nation's military budget.   \n\n> It was Biden who was among the principal and earliest movers of the policy agenda that would become the war on drugs and mass incarceration, and he did so in the face of initial reluctance from none other than President Ronald Reagan. \n\nBiden has never paid a political price for this and it looks like he never will, making his way from Senator to Vice-President to President, as Democrats gave him a pass (he did after all bring in a ton of financial industry money) and moved on to other issues.  The message to politicians is clear - if you want to win elections and advance in politics, just turn poor addicts into criminals.  Of course Biden's own son, Hunter, was addicted to crack and even took photos of himself smoking it, and yet has never served a single day in jail.  Rich kids get treatment and poor kids get locked up.\n\n    It's a losing proposition, But one you can't refuse.\n    It's the politics of contraband, It's the smuggler's blues, \n\nAt this point, even though it's a failed policy, it looks like the odds of ending the drug war are basically zero - there are simply too many people making too much money from it and too many politicians whose careers are invested in it.  And Glen Frey called it back in 1984, and his song has been relevant for 38 years and is still relevant today.","482":"[deleted]","483":"If you're male and having sex with men you have a MUCH higher chance of getting and spreading AIDS.

Those evil leftists must be sneaking CRT on the math curriculum. You might be wondering about the details of this prohibited material, are they teaching that white people are inherently and fundamentally evil? Even worse, are they telling kids that black people aren't terrible? \n\nWell let's see for ourselves what this controversial material consists of. \n\nFrom the New York Times: \n\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/04\/18\/us\/florida-math-textbooks-critical-race-theory.html\n\nA review of sample content from one publisher whose elementary school textbooks appear to have been rejected, Big Ideas Learning, showed lessons intended to build self-awareness, self-management, responsible decision-making and social awareness and relationship skills. \n\nThat framework\u00a0of five skills is a popular one in schools across the country, and was developed by CASEL, an education nonprofit. \n\nIn one text, cartoon animals help build one another\u2019s confidence in order to cross a wobbly bridge. In another, a cartoon dog movie star says she feels lonely, and other animals offer to befriend her. \n\nCASEL defended the idea of including social and emotional concepts in math lessons. \u201cResearch confirms that social and emotional learning bolsters academic achievement because it helps students focus on learning and engage more deeply with content,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIf our nation prioritizes the academic growth of young people, we must also prioritize their social-emotional learning.\u201d \n\nAttempting to stimulate a child's imagination in order to help them engage with otherwise dry arithmetic?

Fittingly, it is produced in the balls, and it's what's responsible for male characteristic traits, both physical and behaviorial. Testosterone is what makes men engage in metaphorical dick waving contests.

No less harmful to be sure, the drive to \"win\" and \"conquer\" in day to day life is what makes men engage in zero sum ventures like daring games at its least pernicious, and profit seeking schemes at its most, where in either case the goal is to gain as much \"capital\" as possible at the expense of everyone and everything else, even if it causes fractures and divisions among each other, stratification of society, and irreparable destruction to the environment and climate. \n\nWhen it comes to attempted reproduction, testosterone is what makes men act irrationally to impress women in often dangerous and stupid ways, often compromising their own or the woman's safety to prove something. Testosterone is what makes a man might think it's a good idea to drive 120mph on a residential road in a Mustang until crashing into an innocent car or home, hurting and killing others for no reason.\n\nMy central point is this: Testosterone kills. It has killed more people than any other chemical in world history.

If you look at when other countries fought, like the Iran-Iraq war, or how the Syrian government fought their civil war, it's chaotic and goes poorly at times. \n\nIf for example China had to fight a massive war against India, it would probably look similar to what is happening in the Ukraine now, and the western media would probably ask \"why were we afraid of China when they are so bad at fighting?\". \n\nHell, if the US ever got their own country invade, they would fight equally bad. Imagine if South America united under some ideology or ruler, then invaded through Mexico.

So here goes.\n\nAlright. I get that someone's voice\/accent can be intentional, but I think saying stuff like 'it annoys the hell of me' does not need to be said. I don't care how annoying you find Kim Kardashian, or regular Joe Shmoe. Like Joe Shmoe might have the same 'accent' as Kim Kardashian, but maybe it's 'unintentional'. I don't get why hating on Kim K's accent is fine but if I hated on, say, some random Indian immigrant it's not. Why is making fun of texas people's accent ok but not, random Chinese dude? A lot of Texans say dumb shit. So do New Yorkers, or Indians, or whatever. However, I don't criticize them for things that really isn't worth criticizing. (And I know reddit loves putting words in my mouth. I don't like Kim Kardashian, but I don't think there's any point in criticizing her 'vocal fry'. Thats her business if she fucks up her vocal cords. I also don't care about Texans for being Texans. Texans that vote for anti abortion laws can fuck off, but I still won't bully them for their accent because just because you have an accent doesn't mean you are anti abortion.) Like, for example, this is unpopular among atheists. It irritates me seeing atheists that, while criticizing  Christians put on a Texan accent. Imagine if I was criticizing 'Indians' and put on a fake Indian accent and going like 'see this is all the dumb shit Indians say'.\n\nAn accent is like a stutter. Not everyone can just switch off accent any more than you can switch off stutter. And if you can, it's very hard.\n\nPeople with high voices also can't help it. Yeah, some people fake it, but damn, if you've ever been nervous, your voice goes high too. Honestly, why does it need to be said?

Have a hatred of \u201cChad\u201d, an amalgamation of various male archetypes that basically amounts to the \u201cguy that gets all the girls\u201d, leaving none for them\n\n3.) Wish harm upon women and Chad, the \u201cgatekeepers of sex\u201d, and congregate in various forums\/communities to speak ill of them and describe all the disgusting, heinous shit they want to happen to them (seriously, if you check out some of the incel forums, they venerate school shooters like Elliot Rodger and constantly wish for women to be killed, raped, or enslaved)\n\n4.) Could probably get laid if they lowered their standards, worked on themselves, or just rented a hooker. For example, maybe they should stop trying to get with 10s right out the gate. Or if they\u2019re really deadset on someone out of their league, they could work out, get therapy, and overall try to be a more attractive prospect as a partner. This isn\u2019t a guarantee that the incel can eventually get with their \u201cdream\u201d girl, but doing these at least increases the chances of it. And if they don\u2019t end up with them, hey, they\u2019re in a better position to find a partner even if whoever it is isn\u2019t their \u201cfirst choice\u201d. Alternatively, if self-betterment sounds like too much work and sex is the only goal, just pay for it. No shame in that.\n\nSex has never been a fundamental human right. Incels aren\u2019t even being denied sex, they\u2019re being denied access to sex with women they find sexually attractive.

Wish harm upon landlords, the \u201cgatekeepers of housing\u201d and congregate in various forums\/communities to speak ill of them and describe all the disgusting heinous shit they want to happen to them (seriously, check out some of the anti-landlord subreddits, they call all landlords names like pigs\/leeches, and venerate people like Mao Zedong by saying shit like \u201cMao was right\u201d. Yes, that same Mao that lead the slaughter of landlords in China. Also the same Mao who would ironically become China\u2019s biggest landlord, but we don\u2019t talk about that)\n\n4.) Could have housing if they just lowered their standards, worked on their finances, or just rented. For example, maybe they should stop trying to buy in an HCOL area. They could move to a cheaper state or even country. Or, if they\u2019re really deadset on a certain housing market, they could work harder, try to make a business, or pivot into an industry that pays more. This is not a guarantee that that dreamhouse will eventually become affordable, but if they don\u2019t end up with that house, hey, at least they\u2019re in a better position to find a nice house even if whereever\/whatever it is isn\u2019t your \u201cfirst choice\u201d. Or just rent! There\u2019s nothing wrong with renting forever. \n\nHome-ownership has never been a fundamental human right. Access to shelter is, and in most cases they are not being denied this. They\u2019re being denied access to shelter\/housing in \u201cnice\u201d communities\/neighborhoods, but nobody is entitled to live in a specific place. It sucks that they can\u2019t participate in their preferred housing market, but believe me when I say there are probably thousands more in their price range.

You also repetitively see erectile dysfunctions consequences being described as \"being worried you can't please your wife?\", seriously? If your dick can't get hard is that actually your biggest concern? How is is that women always complain about how men are selfish in the bedroom when like 80% of men seem to have their partner's pleasure paramount. I also have seen men explain that they can't enjoy it of she doesn't orgasm and they don't feel like a real man. I have even read that some men can ejaculate just by giving oral sex to a woman, WTF!? How!? There is no way any woman would be able to do that without being touched. I was bullied in school and have misogyny issues due to it and issues with my mother, it's a really long story but as a coping mechanism I began to fantasise about being a CEO and forcing my secretaries to have sex with me and suck my dick under the desk while I work. I no longer support this morally but it still turns me on. I am recovering from my misogyny and have gone a long way since then(currently 17) and I particularly fantasised about my female school bullies becoming my secretaries and about fucking my male school bullies girlfriends\/wives, whilst most boys thought about their crushes. Also, most men and teenaged boys seem to very aroused by hearing women moan and groan of sexual pleasure and pleasured facial expressions, this is almost a turn-off for me and it was hard to find porn that didn't include that, my porn was always boss-secretary porn. My desires for lovey-dovey affection have re-developed and it is confusing for me. Most women on the other hand will not tolerate anything less than men assuring they will make them orgasm first(which is paramount for most men anyway). Yet women still complain that men are selfish jerks who only care about themselves. I know that women have the experience of having sex with multiple men and provide a preponderantly credible perspective but it's pretty hard to believe they are not exaggerating and being biased judged by what I have observed from men online and in person.","558":"This is something that feminists like to complain about nowadays. They seem to have this idea that an older man having a younger girlfriend or even just having sex with a younger woman is controlling and predatory, some even claim that it's a sign he \"would go younger if it was legal\". This is just unhinged.\n\n18 is the age of consent because it's the age where it can reasonably be expected that someone, male or female, can understand the implications and potential effects of their actions, as well as being able to grasp the fact that other people may or may not have your best interests in mind. In other words, below 18 we as a society understand that social or emotional incompetence is natural and developmental, whereas after this it becomes a flaw of character if it persists.\n\nWith that in mind, it's entirely possible to not think in terms of laws and still go \"that 19 year old girl that's coming on to me? Fine! That 16 year old girl? She's too young, I should leave her alone.\" The idea that the only reason such a man would respect the age of consent is legal consequences only makes sense if you think the age of consent is arbitrary.\n\nAnd before anyone accuses me of being a creepy middle aged perv, I'm in my early 20s.","559":"The last thing I want to see after losing a game is see someone say gg.

UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.\u201d\n\nAnd by a later Tesla statement:\n\n\u201cElon\u2019s tweet was simply a recognition of the fact that unlike Tesla, we\u2019re not aware of a single UAW-represented automaker that provides stock options or restricted stock units to their production employees, and UAW organizers have consistently dismissed the value of Tesla equity as part of our compensation package,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cWe fundamentally believe it\u2019s critical that all employees be owners of Tesla so that everyone is on the same team, with all sharing in the company\u2019s success.\u201d\n\n[https:\/\/uaw.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/2018-UAW-Constitution.pdf](https:\/\/uaw.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/2018-UAW-Constitution.pdf)\n\nIt is also entirely possible that this was a veiled threat, and a judge ruled it was in the proceeding court case. However, the court proceeding provided doesn\u2019t offer an investigation into possible alternative interpretations of the tweet aside from a threat. It seems weird, however, maybe it was omitted from the document? I can\u2019t find any convincing arguments within the preceding that prove it was a threat, however, this still remains a possibility.\n\n**Elon musk is a union buster:**\n\nMost of this circles around this court case:\n\n[https:\/\/www.courthousenews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tesla-nlrb.pdf](https:\/\/www.courthousenews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tesla-nlrb.pdf)\n\nThe take away\u2019s are:\n\nElon musk had a meeting with two employees seeking a union. In the meeting, he expressed that unionizing would give the union itself a voice, not tesla employees, and invited them to attend a weekly safety committee to express their concerns. Elon then said, if the committee doesn\u2019t work out, \u201cwe\u2019ll give you your union\u201d;\n\nFive employees were passing out union leaflets in the facility's parking lot. Working independently of musk, multiple different security guards repeatedly asked them for their employee badges and to leave the premises. One guard expressed an anti-union settlement, and the employees finally left after an employee falsy claiming to be from hr talked with them directly. These actions are considered illegal, as the security guards were considered to have \u201cactual or apparent authority to act on behalf of the party.\u201d\n\nMy interpretation:\n\nThere is no proof or reason to believe they were acting directly under the authority of musk, however, this reflects poorly on tesla as a company. Throughout the document, it seems tesla, from the managers to workers generally have hostile anti-union stances independent of musk himself and acted autonomously to intervene in a small but legal rally. Musk is seemly not guilty of suppressing unions, but instead, negligence in properly educating his employees about the rights of fellow employees\/ properly enforcing said rights.\n\nNext, two members of the protest were later found to have taken information on pro-union employee\u2019s salary from an app used at the plant and published it on a private Facebook page.\n\nInciting report:\n\n\u201cDuring this conversation, Pratt told Gecewich that he sent the Facebook post to Hedges and had received the information from employee Bryan Kostich (Kostich) (Tr. 1086). Pratt told Gecewich that the Facebook post was from a Facebook page called, \u201cFair Future at Tesla\u201d (Tr. 1086). Gecewich testified that Pratt told him that he thought the information in the Facebook post was inappropriate as it included how much money employees made at Respondent, and Pratt thought that he was being singled out (Tr. 1807\u20131808). Pratt complained that he felt uncomfortable with Ortiz speculating how much he made as well as the posting of his name and picture (Tr. 1807\u20131808).\u201d\n\nOrtiz\u2019s Interrogation:\n\nGecewich started the meeting by asking about the Workday profile screenshots on the Facebook post. Gecewich and Ortiz then had a conversation about where the screenshots came from. Ortiz eventually admitted that it must have been Moran who sent the screenshots to him via text message but that he had received these screenshots from others as well (Tr. 530, 1842). Apparently prior to his meeting with Gecewich, Moran spoke to Ortiz about his meeting with Gecewich. During this meeting with Gecewich, Ortiz expressed concern about being fired and was worried in the prior meeting that he would be fired. Ortiz also spoke about his nature not to bring others into his own problems, and that he was protecting other employees including Moran (Tr. 1842\u20131844). By the end of this meeting, Ortiz had told Gecewich from where the photos had come.\n\nThe stated reason for termination:\n\nAfter these meetings with Ortiz and Moran, Gecewich drafted a report of his investigation with recommended actions (Tr. 1846, 1850). Gecewich testified that he based his recommendations on looking at similar cases as well as the \u201cunique facts of this case\u201d (Tr. 1851). Gecewich testified that he considered Workday profile photos and any Workday screenshots to be sensitive; Gecewich\u2019s characterization of the Workday photos or screenshots is based on his own belief that Workday is an internal data system (Tr. 1935). During his investigation, Gecewich claimed he never sought to learn what happened in Sacramento, went to the Facebook page to look at the page and never found out who were the members of the Facebook group (Tr. 1823, 1835). After drafting the report, Gecewich showed it to Tesla\u2019s in-house counsel (Tr. 1849). Gecewich\u2019s recommendation for termination of Ortiz and warning for Moran were \u201caligned with legal\u201d (Tr. 1930). But a prior version of his report shows that Gecewich along with in-house counsel edited the investigatory report which was originally created on October 12 (GC Exh. 85). In a prior version of this report, Gecewich wrote, \u201cThis time frame corresponds to when these three Tesla employees went to Sacramento, California to speak with State legislatures about on behalf of Tesla\u201d (Tr. 2201)\n\nOrtiz\u2019s termination:\n\nMcIntosh testified that Gecewich began the meeting by informing Ortiz that the investigation he had conducted was closed (Tr. 2066). According to McIntosh, Gecewich told Ortiz that he was found to be dishonest during the process as he was not forthcoming about some images or where the images came from and recommended termination.\n\nMy personal interpretation of events:\n\nA tesla manager fired an employee unlawfully and tesla's legal council okayed the termination based on what said manager provided them. Again reflects poorly on tesla, however, there is no concrete evidence that Elon musk was directly involved in said firing or that the firing was covertly because of Ortiz\u2019s attempts at unionizing. Any claims of union-busting fall into the realm of speculation, and if so are likely solely Cecewich\u2019s personal motives. My speculation is that Elon Musk was not directly involved in Ortiz\u2019s firing, and especially not on the basis of Ortiz\u2019s pro-union stances. Ortiz and his five supporters are a vast minority of the plant's 10,000 and likely wouldn\u2019t have gained traction in such an anti-union work culture. I personally do not see any reason Elon musk would go out of his way to have Ortiz fired other than pure spite, which is possible but unlikely.\n\n**Elon musk p guy tweet:**\n\n[**https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/2j6kr9hu**](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/2j6kr9hu)\n\nSeams like it was a mildly derogatory slang term in South Africa possibly particularly prevalent where he grew up.

Tesla has taken a step forward to ensure its batteries are more socially responsible and a step back. Firstly they are attempting to shift away from using cobalt in their batteries, using a more advanced version of Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries starting in their Chinese market. However, In order to ensure a steady supply of cobalt while they make this transition, they\u2019ve entered an exclusive deal with Glencore. The company is known as one of the more ethical cobalt suppliers however in spite of this there is still evidence of child labor within Glencore\u2019s supply lines: [https:\/\/freedomcollaborative.org\/newsletter-archive\/a-swiss-company-profits-from-child-labour-and-perilous-conditions-in-a-bolivian-mine](https:\/\/freedomcollaborative.org\/newsletter-archive\/a-swiss-company-profits-from-child-labour-and-perilous-conditions-in-a-bolivian-mine)\n\nAnalysis:\n\nIt seems Tesla is attempting to faze out cobalt use as much as they can without affecting their profit margins. Clearly, the continual use of it is still immoral and this is a valid criticism of Musk and Tesla, However, Tesla isn\u2019t as utterly uncaring about the issue as people claim.\n\nElon musk tax evasion:\n\n[https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/12\/22\/elon-musk-says-his-wealth-isnt-a-deep-mystery-his-taxes-are-simple.html](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/12\/22\/elon-musk-says-his-wealth-isnt-a-deep-mystery-his-taxes-are-simple.html)\n\nMath is simple, most of Elon's net worth is tesla stock which is considered unrealized gains and isn\u2019t taxed which explains the discrepancy between his net worth and taxes. If you owned stocks, bitcoin, or any other asset that can increase in value then you wouldn\u2019t pay taxes on it either. The reason he didn't pay taxes in 2018 is that he accidentally overpaid in 2017.","561":"[removed]","562":"They're violent wife beating racist petty tyrants who kill a shitload of people and have no regard for the people they are supposedly there to protect. They have a gang mentality. Individual officers who are \"good\" are still enabling the behavior of the other scum and upholding unjust laws and an unjust system.","563":"No one wants to be labeled negatively for their views, especially in the political atmosphere. Furthermore, no one wants to be labeled negatively for their political views when it's mostly considered an anomaly in their communities. This argument obviously applies to minorities, particularly racial, ethnic, and religious who vote Republican and not Democrat. When they usually do that, they're labeled as Uncle Toms, sellouts, etc. In particular, these terms are mostly applied to Blacks, but they're also labeled towards others as well. The reason is that their critics view the Republican Party as detrimental in their eyes in terms of race, gender, religion, etc. This has led to a lot of Conservatives to call the people who use such terms as racists. I overall agree that no one should label someone who has different views as you by a certain expression. You can debate them but it shouldn't get to the point that you have to start name-calling. That being said, there's an obvious reason why they use these terms and for the most part, they do have a legitimate point. If they want this to stop, this is what Minority Conservatives need to do to prevent it from continuing.\n\nLet's start off by saying that individualism and personal responsibility are overall great notions. No one wants to live a life of being a victim and being dependent all the time. Everyone wants to be successful. But what happens if it gets to a point that you make blanket statements associating negative stereotypes with the broader community that you're supposed to uplift and inspire so they can succeed just as much as you do? Obviously, people will get offended and you will be rightfully called out for it. As a result, you will not be considered a great role model in their eyes.\n\nThe above argument is an example of the trap that many Minority Conservatives fall into. They use personal responsibility and individualism by making themselves look morally superior to others. This results in them constantly bashing their community by associating negative stereotypes about them, including people who don't fit such stereotypes. They say things like they have a victim or plantation mentality, are obsessed with complaining all the time, are lazy, incompetent, want freebies, and constantly make poor choices like committing crime, doing drugs, skipping school, joining gangs, having out-of-wedlock children, etc. That is why they're always unsuccessful. With that type of condescending attitude, how do you think you'll win over your community like that? Furthermore, they and the majority of their fellow Conservatives (majority of them being White) view Minorities through the lens of poverty if they vote Democrat and if they're successful, work hard, do well in school, have a decent income, have a strong family background, avoid gang activity, don't use drugs, etc., they vote Republican. There are a lot of successful minorities in America who fit all these categories and they don't vote Republican. Furthermore, there are a lot of prosperous Middle and Upper-Class neighborhoods and suburbs in America populated by minorities who tend to lean Democrat. What do they have to say about that? Are they existent to them or not? Because it doesn't sound like they are.\n\nAnother argument that I want to make in regards to the statement I wrote above is that Conservatives will be the first to accuse Liberals of thinking minorities are a monolith who should think one way. But what they fail to realize is that they're doing the exact same thing. The Minority Conservatives are just as guilty of doing that as well. In fact, they're the repeat offenders of it. Overall, they think that the minorities are incapable of thinking for themselves. I really can't help but ask them if they see the hilarious and blatant irony in their arguments cause it seems like they don't. But hey, projection is their jam.\n\nTo close off, my message to all the current and incoming Minority Conservatives is this: If you don't want to be called Uncle Tom, don't mistake Personal Responsibility and Individualism for putting down your own race, religion, etc. in order to gain acceptance from the majority, let alone the minority. It doesn't matter if you're White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, etc. It's cringeworthy and surprisingly enough, it's considered an example of shameless pandering. Not only that, you're creating new stereotypes of your demographic that are just as bad as the ones you claim to be against. We all know how you and the rest of your fellow White Conservatives love to criticize Liberal-leaning Whites for being self-loathing and having White Guilt and going further by referring to them as cucks, beta males, soyboys, girly boys, brown nosers, coal burners, etc. (all of which are similar in context to Uncle Tom and should be dubbed racist as well). I agree, it's just as cringeworthy. But that doesn't mean you should accept Minority Self-Loathing as well as Minority Guilt either, whether it be Black Guilt, Hispanic Guilt, Jewish Guilt, and Muslim Guilt. If you really want to bring change, don't be condescending to your audience. You're meant to be role models not grifters. And since Conservatives claim to not see color and see individualism, don't generalize your audience as a whole. Many of the Conservative outlets that you supposedly follow like Fox News and Breitbart have a tendency of looking down on minorities and generalizing them a lot instead of viewing them as individuals as they claim to believe, in particular the former when it comes to crime committed by minorities. An obvious example being \"13%\". It definitely is possible to be a Minority Conservative while not being a total and complete sellout. Good Luck, you'll need it.","564":"OK, I've had this exact conversation enough times that I feel it is relevant to make a post about it.\n\nEvery once in awhile somebody will make the claim that \"the fact America elected Trump in 2016 I'd indicative of the fact that Americans are tired of woke BS\" or some other variation of that claim.\n\nAnd then somebody else will come along and point out that \"well it's not really indicative of the way Americans feel because most Americans voted against Trump\" \n\nAnd then the original person or some other conservative will jump in to point out that \"the popular vote doesn't decide the election\"\n\nYes, of course that's true, but that's not what the conversation was about.

The worst time to explain periods to young girls would be after they took place because they wouldn't understand it if no one told them.

I do not hate Ukraine or the Ukrainian people, nor do I hate Russia or the Russian people. This isn't about me hating Ukraine, but it does about me seeing what the likely future will be for Ukraine. I could be wrong, but you know.  \n\n\nHere's what I think will happened:\n\nIf, and its a big if, Ukraine does get Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea back people will start complain about Ukraine the same way they do on Israel and the west bank.\n\nYesterday, Zelensky said in an interview that Ukraine will become a big Israel and not like the liberal western European countries.\n\nWhat he meant by this was that Ukraine will start to militarize and develop its own weaponry that fits its needs as well as start doing policies like mandatory service, big defense budget etc.\n\nBut what will also happened is that Ukrainian society will also become much alike Israeli society. I wont go over about everything it means but for our purpose this means that Ukrainian society will be more acceptable towards losing liberties if it means security, and it makes since because we Israelis were too willing to give up on liberties like with the mandatory service in the IDF because it means that our country will be safe, that what he meant by not wanting to be liberal western country.\n\nAnd another thing that will happened to Ukrainian society is that it will become more paranoid, after all, it was Russian citizens from your country who revolted and joined sides with Russia and those separatists were Russians, and I dont really think anyone gonna mind the amount of Russians who did not support the separatists, because after all, if they wanted to live in Ukraine they should have packed their bags and migrated to their country. They would pretty much give the \"compliance is soft support\" like they did with the Russians who live in Russia and dont overthrow their government since you know, they revolted and overthrew their government back in 2014. This isn't me saying that Ukrainian society will be racist, its just it will be more of \"respect and suspect\" kind of deal, like we have with the non Bedouin Israeli Arabs.\n\nSo what will happened? Well, first there will be marshal law across those liberated places, then, the population will be under surveillance and be suspected in case they ever try to separate again, which could happened since any separatist with luck that had managed to run way before hand will most likely be a terrorist and attack across the border like the Palestinian Fedayeen. Next, the Russian speaking population will start to feel antagonized and would wish for Russian liberation back again, or better yet they would form their own nationalism that is distinct enough from Ukraine and Russia. Golda Meir said that Palestinians dont exist but she was half true at her time, those countries in the middle east has only existed for around 20-30 years at this point and only existed cause a European diplomat said so.\n\nNext, those liberated areas will start harboring terrorist organizations disguised as Russian liberation organization or LLO if you want. A situation that will force the Ukrainian army to deploy troops there to arrest and eliminate those terrorist cells, and since this is soldiers v terrorists in urban environment, civilians will get killed. Ukrainian soldier killed them? Terrorist? Doesn't matter he's a martyr from now on.\n\nAll these things and more will probably lead to a Russian intifada, that will force Ukraine to go hard against those terrorists, and if a peace deal is ever made with that LLO, it would probably be sort lived as this deal will only give whoever in charge of that LLO a cover for any illegal activities he might want to do.\n\nAnd we forgot about Ukrainian people, who some will probably migrate back to these regions, putting them in conflict with the local population who would look at them as settlers that try to destroy the identity of the region.\n\nAnd add to that the fact that Russia, while weak diplomatically, could still recover from this war and gain allies diplomatically, allies that could antagonize Ukraine in the UN. Not to mention all the propaganda it still could employ, showing pics of dead children in Donetsk and saying \"this is what Ukrainian troops do\" while completely ignoring the fact there was an ambush of Russian terrorists on Ukrainian soldiers who caused a stray bullet to kill the kid.\n\nAnd you wondering how will the people of Ukraine will react to all of these? The same way we react in Israel. When we hear news about dead terrorist in Jenin we celebrate that a massacre has been avoided, when we think about the soldiers in the west bank we think of the separation wall (which is actually most just fence but still) we think of the fact that after construction it lowered the terrorists attack rate by 90% When we remember the disengagement from Gaza with all these settlers we think that they were, for a lack of a better term, ungrateful bastards who elected a terrorist group that shouldn't have been on the ballot in the first place, a group that launched rockets at our cities from hospitals and schools, which makes it even harder to pull the trigger when it comes to air strikes, heck we had to invent roof knocking with bombs.\n\nAnd why can we put up with all this things like mandatory service, the government being able to see what's on your phone at any time, delays of security when going to the airport? High budget for the armed forces? Any killing of Palestinians (innocent or guilty) Because in our society, that will soon become Ukrainian society too, security is above all else, because its better to be safe now and sorry later, because you cannot allow yourself to lose the next war because then you wont even have a country.\n\nSo now you got all of these factors, all the terrorism, nationalistic people that want security, propaganda machine of Russia, separatists who wished to break away. And now tell me reddit wont flood with \"free Donetsk\" And Al Jazeera will call for Zelensky to be brought to the Hauge.\n\nthe internet will call out Ukraine as an apartheid for not letting Russians, who I should remind you were separatists not so long ago, be completely free and that they should \"break the chains\".\n\nAnd Putin and Russia?

In the real world, there is (almost) NEVER a situation where the child would get hit or physically punished.\n\n**BUT, in the real world...**\n\n* **Children WILL be subjected to verbal abuse.** *Examples: Angry boss or angry customer yells at employee.

We have been conditioned to want a materialistic, shallow, and hypercapitalist lifestyle and world order by propaganda from plutocratic states and megacorporations.\n\nWe do not have real democracy, certainly not where I live in the US, and not even really in Europe. Democracy requires true equality, which no modern capitalist \"democracy\" possesses, by virtue of the fact every country, even the relatively \"egalitarian\" Scandinavian social democracies, have people far wealthier and disproportionately influential than any others. In the US, it is absurd to claim we have \"democracy\" when the two-party system is little more than a neoliberal puppet of the capitalist class; the idea the average citizen, no matter how thoughtful or rational their ideas are, has any chance of being acknowledged on anything more than a token handshake or vague and empty response from his representative's staffers, is absurd. Don't get me wrong, I love our constitutional civil liberties, but time and time again, we see these rights\u2014even when the constitution is very clear from a frank and common-sense perspective\u2014be ignored or rationalized away if they are too inconvenient for the ruling class: NSA warrantless mass surveillance, internal border checkpoints, bans on civilian ownership of fully-automatic weapons (\"shall not be infringed\"), solitary confinement and other torture (\"cruel and unusual punishment\"), perpetual copyright, de facto wars without congressional approval, and holding prisoners without trial, all of these are very clearly unconstitutional to anyone with high school education in the English language who is being honest to themselves, yet all are rationalized and excused away be the courts nonetheless. Why? Because an entrenched elite *always* continually accumulates more and more power, and civil liberties, by there very nature liberties *the government* \"guarantees\" to not infringe, are inherently on very shaky ground. This is true of every state society, including Iceland, New Zealand, Sweden, and other societies we think of as near perfect democracies. Guess what? Wiemar Germany and Chile under Allende were \"thriving constitutional democracies, \"and yet they too fell to brutal dictatorial thugs.\n\nAn example of a true democracy would be the Iroquoian confederacies of the Northeastearn Woodlands prior to European destruction: Lack of significant financial inequality, a class system, presence of regular community meetings between true equals, and perhaps most importantly, the right to leave one's community or disobey orders from the Sachem or Clan Mother. Yes, there were exceptions to these rules, such as the Mourning Wars where captives were taken, and a maniac would be restrained or probably killed if s\/he caused danger or severe disturbance. Obviously their societies were hardly perfect, but then you can note South Korea is hardly perfect from the standpoint of a truly democratic society, yet for a North Korean it would seem almost unimaginably good by comparison. But the Wyandot, Iroquois, and Neutral Nations had no prisons, no entrenched class system, and no significant economic inequality. No Iroquoian man, woman, or child had to worry about being evicted from their home if they couldn't pay rent, suck up to a boss they hate because they have to pay back their student loan debts. And while the False Face Society was very secretive, unlike the NSA, the KGB, or MI5 members of the False Face Society weren't constantly watching you in your longhouse, when you went hunting, or listening to your conversations with your family or friends. And the False Face Society\u2014or indeed, the Grand Council itself\u2014didn't force you to fork over 30% of your corn crop or catch in deer meat every year and send heavily-armed men to drag you out of your corn field when you least expected it and put you in a cage if you refused, and if you physically resisted these heavily-armed men you wouldn't be locked up in the cage for still longer or even killed on the spot.\n\nTo live in a world without this oppression, you need to get rid of centralization. Centralization isn't just in the state; our economic and technological system, by virtue of the phenomenal level of specialization and resources required to make modern electronics,  which modern aircraft, automobiles, agriculture, energy grids, factories, food production\u2014including so called \"green\" foods like Beyond and Impossible Ersatz meat\u2014requires centralization. Centralization inherently breeds hierarchy, and hence we'd be back to being slaves of the ruling class and the state, maybe in some different form, i.e. right-libertarian corporatocracy or a quasi-pharoanic religious autocracy, but it will *inevitably* reemerge.\n\nOne of the most iron laws of history is this: Every time a leader or small elite are trusted with power, especially when massive amounts of theorizing and selecting the \"benevolent\" monarch or dictator, or \"strong\" checks and balances, things will return to a similarly highly unequal, unjust, and rigged system as the old one in time, unless the new system becomes even worse. The only societal systems which truly work over the long-term are stateless societies: Witness Native Californians, Australian Aborigines, Iroquoian and Algonquian peoples, and Khoisan bands in Southern Africa. Or, the longevity of modern Pueblo villages compared to the brief glory and then collapse of the Chacoan regime.\n\nIn time, if we don't stop this ship from sailing into the rock, it *will* be too late, because technology *will* become too advanced to stop. Which brings me to my last, and perhaps gravest, concern: AI. In the times of the Haitian Revolution, if enough people got really really mad, the weapons of the elite were not so overwhelmingly superior a mass of the poor, working class, and underclasses could simply overpower them. Also, surveillance in even the most despotic preindustrial states pales in comparison to the what your boss can see on \"your\" company phone from his desk at work, let alone the truly behemoth power of the supercomputers of modern militaries and intelligence agencies. AI will either lead to one or two outcomes, probably both, in order: It will enable a totalitarian system where the elite enjoy near absolute power and luxury; and\/or it will ultimately overthrow *all* mankind, and possibly destroy all life on Earth in an endless quest for resources, depending on its fundamentally inhumane motives.\n\nThe only long term solution I can see is this: We have to overthrow the techno-capitalist system and adopt a stateless, sustainable agrarian system of societies the world over. This system will not be uniform, far from it. I can easily see dry coastal areas being based on fisheries and aquaculture, not unlike what the Ancient Peruvians and Northwest Coast Peoples relied on; forest, wetland, and other well-watered areas being covered in vast forest gardens with many types of small livestock, fish, insects, and fungi being part of the local diets; dry and mediterranean areas being based on transhumance or clever irrigated agriculture, perhaps like the systems the Pueblo peoples have perfected over the centuries; boreal forests, tundra, and polar areas focused on reindeer or yak herding, low-input forest gardening systems, or hunter-gatherer ways.\n\nI do not support returning to a purely hunter-gather existence. This is unjust, because it requires almost everyone on Earth to starve to death. It is a false dichotomy, because many \"hunter-gatherer\" cultures like the Owens Valley Paiute, California natives, and even Australian Aborigines (read *Dark Emu*) practised what was basically equivalent to agriculture, just not *European* field and monoculture-based agriculture. Not to mention many, *many* long-standing, largely egalitarian traditional societies which practised what is indisputably agriculture, such as the New Guineans, the Puebloans, Iroquoians, many Amazonian peoples, and peoples of the Matrilineal Belt of Africa.\n\nThis does not mean we should reject *all* technology. Traditional systems of irrigation, metallurgy, water and wind mills, paper, printing presses, concrete, etc. and other technologies are objectively different from modern petrol engines, jumbo jets, spacecraft, superalloys, or nanotechnology in that they can be very easily decentralized. To make concrete all that is needed is lime, aggregate, and baked clay\u2014indeed, several traditional societies invented just this process. Ironworking is a hallmark of tribal Bantu Africa. Paper requires only fibre, water, and lye, the last of which can be easily obtained from burning seaweed, coastal plants, or certain trees.\n\nWe must make this transition now before it is too late. We must revitalize ourselves, and renew Mother Earth.","602":"[deleted]","603":"It's pretty simple, if you support the police you are supporting politcal violence. It's not often called that because it's against the interests of the state but its true on its face.

why you may happen across cats that have been hit by cars far more than dogs? because people prefer dogs. because dogs, for a particular reason, are viewed as \"better.\" i've seen so many people say that \"if you're not a dog person then you're a psychopath.\" and there's also so many negative stigmas surrounding cat lovers aka \"the crazy cat lady\" or \"witches and cats\" etc. people adopt and breed dogs endlessly, while cats are left out on the streets to fend for themselves. but honestly, i see more red flags with being a dog person. dogs are some of, if not *the* *most* submissive animals on the planet. they cater to your every demand, they flood you with attention and love, they submit to you in every way, they struggle to learn boundaries - and they've been genetically designed to be this way... to submit to humans. im sorry, but it's **weird.** if you hate cats because they're independent and think for themselves, then in my opinion *that's* more alarming... to hate something that doesn't submit to you.\n\n- (EDIT) dogs pose a bigger threat to humans. their bites are stronger, and when aggressive they can actually severely injure and even *kill* people. i've seen so many articles and news clips of dogs attacking, injuring, and killing humans. i've even heard of a dog biting off a toddler's arm, or a pack of dogs dragging someone into a ditch and chewing off their face. dogs are more violent, and some are even bred to be fighters. i've personally witnessed multiple dogs become aggressive and bite or slash open their owners, and other people around them, to the point of drawing blood and punching holes into the people's skin with their teeth.\n\nall around cats are just better in so many ways.\n\nEDIT: to those of you bringing up the brain fungus argument, more than a third of the world population has this brain fungus you speak of. studies have shown that most, nearly all, people who have this brain fungus are not affected by it at all. and cat owners aren't the only ones who have it.\n\nfrom an article on inverse, \"These findings go far beyond cat lovers. Researchers say understanding microglia's defense capabilities could lead to better ways of treating other brain infections, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, and autoimmune disorders, like multiple sclerosis and strokes.\" so this brain fungus, and our ability to fight it, is actually helping researchers and scientists be able to study and better understand other neurological diseases\/ailments that need a cure.","607":"Not only did they make themselves the most important thing at the Oscars, but philosophically, I agree with both sides. I'm not even a Will Smith fan but some people do deserve a slap in the face. I'm also okay with Chris joking about Jada's baldness even if her condition is medical. The joke was tame and so is medical baldness. Chris also handled it well enough. Will got away with assault\/battery, got an Oscar, defended his wife. Chris is admired for his restraint and professionalism. People actually cared about the Oscars again. It was exciting; like Chris said, it was the greatest moment in the history in television. Everybody was smiling. Will laughed, Chris laughed, we laughed. This is a win-win-win for everybody!","608":"This opinion obviously applies to the current situation we have regarding COVID-19. With many precautions being implemented over the past several months in order to combat the virus, there's been some people out there who think they are so entitled to dismiss the severity of it, whether it be masks, vaccines, mandates, social distancing, etc. Instead, they claim to rely on their immune system, which in my opinion isn't really enough to combat it and it shows. As a result, they resort to calling those who heed to such precautions as sheep and lab rats. They even go further by harassing and threatening doctors who do their job to help cure patients affected by it as well as parents who decide to mask their children as child-abusers to comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust. And for the most part, these people obviously tend to be Conservative and are unvaccinated. But at the end of the day, who is getting affected and dying? The Unvaccinated or Vaccinated? The answer for the most part is the Unvaccinated. Why do you think that is? Obviously because they're constantly being fed propaganda and misinformation. Now, these people are suffering the consequences of their actions and their friends and family suffer as well. If anything, it seems to me that these people are the real sheep not the ones who they constantly accuse of. These are the same people who also for the most part don't tend to take any personal responsibility, especially since I mentioned before, the victims are mostly Conservative and personal responsibility is one of its main tenets. In conclusion, the real sheep who are being sent to the slaughter are the unvaccinated. Their constant obsession with owning the libs in the name of freedom have all but backfired. Hell, even our former president admitted that the unvaccinated are dying at a higher rate than those who are and he said it to a Conservative pundit straight to her face. He even got booed at a rally for taking the vaccine and even recommended his base to take it to no avail. Two examples that validate my opinion on this issue are Kelly Ernby and Robert Lamay.\n\nKelly Ernby, a former California prosecutor rallied against Covid vaccine precautions comparing it to socialism. She died of COVID complications in early January at the age of 46 setting off a chain reaction between the vax and antivax movements. Now, let's get to the next and main one: Robert Lamay. This death by far is one of the worst deaths of them both. This former Washington State Trooper had to retire early back in October due to his unvaccinated status and his criticism of the state's Democratic governor made him a viral sensation. He even had an interview with Fox News over it, which is pretty ironic since the studio has strict vaccine mandates themselves and 90% of their staff is vaccinated. This is clearly obvious over the fact that the interview he conducted with them took place in his squad car. Fast forward to February and he's dead as a doornail at age 50 from COVID and he leaves behind a wife and 4 children. Meanwhile, the studio for the most part remained silent.\n\nSo yeah, pretty much. The people who accuse others of being sheep are in reality the biggest sheep of them all. Now the question remains: Should we have empathy for them or not if they get affected and die? Obviously, we should. No death should be mocked. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be critical of them. We definitely should because they made a terrible and fatal mistake, one that was easily preventable and they need to be called out on that. Their deaths should also serve as a reminder of what could happen if others made the same mistake and to prevent it from happening. What's even frustrating is that the ignorance of these people is only making it harder to stop the virus. Like I said, personal responsibility and it goes both ways. Whether it be complying with the police as some people cry out, the same logic applies here. Furthermore, dying to own the Libs is not fighting for your freedom. It's fighting for stupidity. It also dramatically decreases your political base.","609":"What a change three weeks make for the savages of reddit.

The wagging its tail excuse is not valid. Dogs do wag their tail when they attack.","611":"My four biggest problems with this controversy:\n\n1) It\u2019s obviously manufactured by the media for ratings and rage clicks. There are just a few trans athletes in this country, and yet each one gets disproportionate press coverage. This is typical of the culture wars stuff Americans are obsessed about, take a small problem and unnecessarily magnify it.\n\n2) Sports is about celebrating the best, the strongest, the fastest. If the female athletes winning gold medals were born men so be it. We shouldn't celebrate mediocrity by letting people who are \"too good\" not get a chance to shine.\n\n3) Nobody cares about other biological factors giving certain groups advantages in athletics. Should freakishly naturally strong cis women be banned too?\n\n4) Conservatives try to turn this into a government issue, passing laws barring trans people from playing sports. I don\u2019t like the state interfering in something as trivial as high school basketball or whatever, especially given the thousands of actual problems affecting working-class people like me that politicians refuse to touch. If there\u2019s a controversy let a sports\u2019 league deal with it, not some fucking senators overreaching their political power.","612":"Let's use common sense for two seconds here. [https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/05\/02\/oscars-2021-nielsen-data-shows-viewers-have-lost-interest-in-award-shows.html](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/05\/02\/oscars-2021-nielsen-data-shows-viewers-have-lost-interest-in-award-shows.html) There was a 51% drop in viewership from 2020. The Oscars are irrelevant, no one cares anymore. How do you regain popularity in the media? Well just have some scripted dramatic event happen and SUDDENLY, EVERYONE on social media just HAS to post about your irrelevant award show and voice their very important opinion on the \"oh em gee\" crazy thing that happened! \"Well they had beef in the past-\" No, you're just gullible.\n\nEdit: They will use this to make the Oscars relevant next year. Just before the Oscars next year, this will trend, everyone will talk about the Oscars, and suddenly an award show that was on life support for interest will be in the limelight again. Not to mention Chris Rock is going on tour next month, great way to get him into the spotlight and promote him since he had become pretty irrelevant before the slap.","613":"Fact is, if Will Smith was a White actor, *any\" White actor, he would be being cancelled as we speak. They'd be screaming about 'Toxic Masculinity', insisting on Anger Management classes in order to keep his Oscar, and of course, chalk it all up to 'Systemic Racism'. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson would be calling for the gas chamber. His career would be ruined. I always knew Will Smith was a piece of garbage. Tonight he proved it.\n\nThis was a harmless joke that everybody snickered at.\n\nAnybody defending Smith is a hypocrite and a fraud.","614":"I don't condone Will Smith attacking Chris Rock. I want to be clear on that. However, I want to be absolutely clear when I say that Will and Jada Smith have received far more criticism than is warranted because of an unorthodox relationship. History will remember them as being ahead of the curve. Not every relationship needs to be polyamorous or open, but shitting on Will at every turn for HIS decision to stay with Jada is none of anyone's damn business, and it's completely unwarranted. \n\nThe fact that people need to constantly draw attention to an extremely personal part of someone's life is not only sad, it's cowardly. People did this for years to Taylor Swift and Britney Spears, only for them to be vindicated years later. Calling Jada a whore is not only misogynistic, but I would argue that it has roots in racism as well. Charlie Sheen had a polyamorous relationship with his \"goddesses\" before his drug-fueled, egomaniacal downfall, but people's perception of him then was largely positive, and certainly never devolved into hurling slurs and lowbrow jokes at him.\n\nI felt the need to write about this because everyone is calling Will Smith crazy and a simp, cuck, whatever other incel insult, and so on. Was he out of line for assaulting Chris Rock? Sure he was. Was it a crime? Of course. Will he face consequences? Not likely, given his fame and fortune. Despite all that though, what we witnessed last night was someone near their breaking point and lashing out. The Smiths, for all their faults and quality of entertainment (I personally don't like Will's movies), do not deserve the vitriol and negativity that the internet is spewing their way. Idk I just felt like I should say something and this is the right subreddit to do it in.","615":"So Will smith's original claim to fame was being the \"clean\" rapper. No foul language and was against the glorification of violence. \n\nYet it's OK to slap a comedian if he pokes a bit of fun at your wife. \n\nIt's all about tone. Chris Rock wasn't being malicious, he was telling a joke. Whether it was a good joke is entirely up to the audience. \n\nHonestly if there is no repercussions for the actions of this we may as well toss the whole justice system. \n\nCelebrities, get over yourselves.

For those who love to appeal to the \u201cdefinition of racism\u201d, I submit to you the comprehensive meaning of the word as detailed by the [NASP](https:\/\/www.nasponline.org\/x26830.xml). It is actually *you* who is changing definitions to fit your perspective, not the other way around.\n\nRedditors argue ad nauseam that racism = discrimination on the basis of race, perceived racial superiority, etc. towards someone else. While half true, the most fundamental aspect of the concept is missing from this definition, resulting in a gross oversimplification that leaves us with a definition much more closely related to racial prejudice rather than racism. As per its sociological application, in order for prejudice to be considered racism, there must be a system and institutions in place with which the dominant group (whites) can benefit from and leverage power over minority or marginalized groups. This is readily observable in the U.S through our policies (Jim Crow, redlining, [the war on drugs](https:\/\/www.brennancenter.org\/our-work\/analysis-opinion\/race-mass-incarceration-and-disastrous-war-drugs)), hiring practices, (applicants with stereotypically white names are hired more frequently over applicants with stereotypically black names, despite the same [qualifications](https:\/\/hbswk.hbs.edu\/item\/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)), the [police system](https:\/\/www.ppic.org\/publication\/racial-disparities-in-law-enforcement-stops\/), and a laundry list of many others. \n\nThis is the foundation on which racism and racist institutions are built\u2014 a system which whites have never suffered at the hands of and never will.

The truth about Zelenskyy is he's a corrupt authoritarian who is very tolerant of Nazis in his country. He is named in the Pandora Papers, Neo-Nazis have official positions in the government and military, and he has been suppressing dissent in his country by banning political parties. Ukraine is not a democracy at all. Joe Biden and the US are propping up this client state so the truth about Hunter Biden doesn't get released to the world. Ukraine might be more authoritarian than Russia is.\n\nThe fact of the matter is the Russian invasion of Ukraine, while horrible and unjustified, was provoked by NATO expansion towards its borders. Putin is only defending his country from the hostile regime and alliance that threatens his country's safety.

Personally, I disagree. I think both are right\n\nYou see, imagine if we are exchanging our thoughts on a book, and the book is neither good nor bad. Some would say 7\/10, and some would say 5\/10. I believe that the latter is correct, because weather it has 100 bad things and 100 good things, or has 1 good thing and 1 bad thing, it is still in the middle. Anything above 5\/10 would mean the good things outweigh the bad things. It doesn\u2019t matter how much, but if the good things weigh more, then it\u2019s above 5\/10. \n\nNow, you may be wondering why I chose to comment on this. My reason is because people are saying 7\/10 is not average in any way, however I disagree. I think it\u2019s the average of all good things. Think about it. A 6\/10 means that the good things, while very small, do slightly outweigh the bad things. A 7\/10, however, means that the good things significantly outweigh the bad things, though there could be significant improvements. (As you go up the rankings the improvements become smaller and smaller). If something is ok, not bab, but pretty ok, then it\u2019s average inside the good side. The same goes for the bad side. A 3\/10 is pretty average for the bad side (it\u2019s bad, but not that bad). \n\nTLDR: 5\/10 is average for everything, and a 7\/10 is average for good things.","652":"Personally, I never got what the entire fuss was about with it. You hear other men often say similar things. \"I would never in my life date, or even have a casual relationship with a chick who does, or ever has done OnlyFans\". They act like the woman has been tainted or is somehow less for it. Personally, I find that equal parts ridiculous, immature, and frankly screwed up. It's something similar like how some men take issue with how many partners a woman's had, sexual wise, which is also beyond stupid. They're not simply like slabs of meat, to marked and thrown in the garbage because they're considered \"used up\" or \"damaged goods\". They're human freaking beings, and thinking that way reveals how narrow minded and shallow a person is.\n\nThe things that should matter, whether you are simply having a casual, friends with benefits thing with a chick, or going above that to date, the only questions you should ask in my personal opinion, should be these. Do I get along with this person? Do we feel safe and happy with one another? Do we share mutual interests, and attraction with each other? And do we make each other's lives better? If the answer to those is yes, pretty much nothing else should matter. So what, people, mostly guys, pay to talk to her and see photgraphs and videos of her? That's a similar situation to the women who model for lingerie and dirty magazines. The key takeaway is this. That is literally all they can do, is talk and stare at their screens. They're not the ones that the chick chooses to let into her bed at night, or into her life. You are. That counts for something, majorly so. \n\nIf I find myself attracted to a woman, if I think she's cool and she can make me laugh and vice versa, and we both find each other interesting, make each other's lives better by the other's prescence and we get along, and of course she's clean from STDs, that's all I care about. I will either date her, or have a casual friends with benefits thing with her, depending on what either of us want out of each other. So, she found a way to make some extra money, and it just so happens to be from her body. That's her choice, and as long as I'm not getting cheated on, I could give a toss less, in fact, I'll support her. If she wants to stop, she's had enough, same thing. And the same goes if she has stuff on it from things she did with past partners. That's the past, and it shouldn't matter if you're not seriously insecure. I don't give a damm what anyone else may think, or the high school like insults and insinuations they may throw my way for it. I'm happily long past the stage of caring about what public perception of me is. \n\nThat's all there is to it.","653":"What you think you know about politics, reality, religion, human nature, philosophy, ethics.. etc. It's almost certainly wrong.

This is unquestionably the most inclusive and equitable route to go and will ensure that no longer are there debates about this league or that league and who competes in whichever one. It is all about competing as a human. And let's admit it, gendered sports leagues have always been sexist and a way to separate and discriminate... part of an antiquated patriarchical system of oppression and marginalization. With everyone competing together on the same playing field, we can celebrate our strengths and skills regardless about what is between our legs and what we might identify as. That is unity.

Mariupol is encircled, Kharkiv and Kiev are almost encircled. I believe these cities will fall in the coming months. If you look at maps of the war, every day, the Russians seem to advance. Not as fast as the Americans did in desert storm, but they are consistently taking Ukraine, piece by piece.\n\nTo me, their defeat seems inevitable. Russia has better equipment, air superiority, more Tanks, more soldiers, and as one would expect, they are winning.\n\nNonetheless, I'm not sure when Ukraine will surrender. Zelensky, and the Ukrainians I know of, seem determined to fight on. The westerners I know very much support them in this. The media keeps praising the Ukrainian war effort.\n\nJust yesterday, Ukraine refused to surrender Mariupol. There still ate hundreds of thousands of civilians there. Encircled, hundreds of miles away from Ukrainian lines. Don't be deluded, there is no relief coming. The only thing the Ukrainians could hope for, is to keep a few Russian regiments busy for a few weeks, while the city gets destroyed, and thousands die pointlessly.\n\nIf the Ukrainians keep going down this road, they will repeat Mariupol in Kharkiv, a city of 1.5 million, and Kiev, a city of more than 3 million. Hundreds of thousands may die, for the sake of making the war last just a few more months.\n\nWhat is the point of this? The Russians have already offered pretty lenient peace terms. Ukrainian neutrality and secession of the Donbass and Crimea. If the Zelensky accepted this peace deal, he might save hundreds of thousands. Yet we westerners continue cheering the Ukrainians on, in their unwinnable fight, to throw away as many young men's lives as they can.\n\nI'm not saying, that Russia should ever have invaded.

The accusation of virtue signaling is virtue signaling.**\n\nAny publicly manifested moral position is a virtue signal. If you accuse someone of hypocrisy you are signaling that you hold moral consistency to be important. If you say people should stand up for the anthem, you are signaling that you care about patriotism. If you denounce people for caring too much about foreign problems, you are signaling how you are above caring for such things.\n\nThe outspoken position that virtue signaling as a bad thing is at best a way to signal that one thinks virtue signaling is wrong and at worst and implication that one is above virtue signaling.\n\nVirtue signaling is morally neutral, it is a normal part of our conversations about morality and has been a facet of society for as long as we have records of moral discussions. People signal\n\n**2\/ The right loves virtue signaling.**\n\nProtect the children! Salute the flag! I worked hard all my life! I don't listen to the mainstream media! I do my own research! I don't get easily offended!  \n\n**3\/ Accusations of virtue signaling say a lot about you.**\n\nIf we agree that everyone virtue signals, then the problem is not virtue signaling, it's the virtues being signaled.\n\nThe right wing loves virtue signaling of patriotism, but hates virtue signaling of anti-racism.\n\nIt loves virtue signaling about protecting the children, but hates virtue signaling about protecting war refugees.\n\nIt loves virtue signaling about not being easily offended, but is deeply offended at how people virtue signal through offense.\n\nThe right accuses people of virtue signaling only insofar as they are signaling for something the right hates, but they cannot admit they hate those things.\n\n---\n\nThe point here is: \"virtue signaling' is just a way to not state some opinion outright. It is, like most accusations favored by right wingers, absolutely meaningless and self-defeating.\n\nI'm here to signal to you the virtue of not falling for such a  stupid rhetorical practice as are accusations of \"virtue signaling\"","686":"Where punishing an entire country for essentially what very small percent of Russians want.

Trans women are women, so feminists should advocate for their rights as well, not just cis women. This is not an unpopular opinion in general, just in this sub.","698":"EDIT: DO NOT TAKE THIS AS AN ENDORESMENT OF RAPE, MODS! I WAS JUST REPORTED AS A POTENTIAL RAPIST ON THE r\/unpopularopinion SUB BY THE MODS BECAUSE THEY MISINTERPRETED THE MESSAGE. I WAS SIMPLY POINTING OUT THE LOGICAL FLAW WITH THIS POLICY, AND THAT OPINION IS UNPOPULAR. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the war in that part of Eastern Europe, a sex discriminatory policy has come into effect regarding the draft in addition to men aged 18-60 being prevented from leaving the country. No such policies are being enacted on the women of the nation, and in fact there are polices to explicitly get women out of the country for their own safety. While people might say something along the lines of \"But its practical for the nation to do these things\", that same reasoning is also the reason for what I said in the title should be allowed.\n\nThe following is exclusively targeted to people who support the male only draft as well as restricted movement for males. I'm also not saying that this should be an enacted policy. I think the draft should apply to both men and women, and I'm just pointing out the logical conclusion the former leads to.\n\nThe primary reason for women being shielded from conflict isn't, as popular opinion seems to think, the fact that women aren't capable of fighting. Its reproductive asymmetry that is the main reason. The concept of a draft is to force a segment of the civilian policy to fight wars, often with minimal training due to the draft being made to supplement a professional army. In the same way women are less capable than men on average to fight, so are regular civilians being conscripted to fight in comparison to professional soldiers. With modern technology, specifically the advancements in firearms, children are fully capable of being used as soldiers if the many conflicts in Africa are to observed. Considering the situation that part of Eastern Europe is in, ever potential soldier they can get would be useful, yet women are still exempt. Its the reproductive asymmetry that matters.\n\nIn the modern context of what can still be applied to today, the average male has the biological capacity to impregnate dozens of females. Meanwhile the average female would probably be capped at 10 children, and that's assuming they are being used as a pseudo-baby factory from 18 years onwards. I don't think I have to explain the 8th grade anatomy as to why this is.\n\nIf the male only draft is being implemented because its more practical for the war, then pro-birthing policies would be made during or after the war itself to recuperate the lost population. When the dust is settled and if that place in Eastern Europe survives, the nation will need to rebuild, not just economically but by population as well. Countries have historically promoted policies that encourage higher birth-rates to replace the dead. Post WW2 USSR is a well known example. If men can be forced to undergo all of that, why should women get a free pass for footing their end of the bill? Why is war mandatory for men, but replacing the shrunken population, something that is in the interest of the nation which the male only draft was also made for, too much?\n\nWith this said, if you think that it is acceptable to force someone into a war they don't want to fight. To risk grievous bodily injury, death, or an extreme form of pain in one or both of those things. To fight for something that may not even believe in, and to trap them in the country in which this conflict is occurring, punishing those who do not obey, then rape is comparatively more acceptable. Is emotional trauma really worse than what I just described? PTSD exists, and I'm pretty sure that your average male civilian who is forced into this situation isn't going to be as mentally tough as regular soldiers, so PTSD rates will be higher.\n\nIn the interest of the nation, women should try and have as many kids as possible until the government says to stop. If you don't want to do this, then remember what happened to the men who refused to fight. What's your excuse for not contributing to the effort as you hopped on a train to safety, leaving your fellow citizens to potentially die, all while you do nothing? Rape isn't even the first answer. The government would probably just tell you to pick someone and go from there. Rape, obviously the kind that would impregnate them, would be the last possible action to be permitted against these women. Complain all you want about the 1900s, that was the time period and its not like life was a living hell for them. Back then, gender (or rather sexual) equality was \"Julie didn't get to go to university, while John didn't get to live\". All the progress that has been made so far. How many \"White Feather Girls\" would refuse service if they were the ones who are told to go to the frontlines to fight with the men? Gender equality means you suffer the same as men, just as much as you prosper. If men who refuse to fight are cowards, what are you? How privileged to you have to be to cry out at the first sign of pain, all while turning a blind eye to, even support the actions that cause pain to others.\n\nIf you are willing to make universal policies that divide people by characteristics they can't change, then don't act like you have the moral high ground when going by your actions.\n\nI could go on and on about the immorality of the women who tout patriotism, encouraging the men to fight all the while they get off scot free, sounding like an incel in the process, but I digress. If you think this comparison is unfair, refer to what I have said already, but also this analogy. Would you be completely okay with some rich boy of fighting age saying:\n\n\"No, I shouldn't be expected to fight. I'm too rich and privileged to subject myself to possible harm. Instead the poor should risk death while I flee to safety, even though the job that I'm given is far less dangerous than the one that others get.\"\n\nAt least in this example the rich person could just pay the government a certain amount, functionally being a draft dodge payment that contributes to the nation. What do the ladies specifically who are currently in places like Poland have to say about what they will contribute, and what should happen if they don't want to \"do their part\"?\n\nAgain, this rant is about the logical extrapolation about certain policies, and I think the draft should apply to men and women, and that rape isn't the answer here.","699":"I personally don't identify as either, but seeing debates between left wing or right wing people, while I think both are toxic, it's funny to see that most left winters rage quit or let words get to them.

As a concept. To me, a lesson on sexual orientation is as simple as, \"some people are gay, some people are straight.\" This is just objective reality that children are going to be exposed to if they meet another child with two moms, or a teacher with a same sex partner. That's why Democrats are calling it the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill: because it literally says you can't instruct about sexual orientation. That's what \"gay\" is. Is it \"deranged\" to worry that gay people can't be acknowledged or talked about in a classroom? Are we saying a gay teacher can't talk about their spouse, but a straight teacher can? Or neither should be allowed to?\n\nAm I missing something? The only argument I could envision from a Right wing proponent is \"well, sexual orientation in the bill doesn't mean *sexual orientation*, it means... blah blah blah.\" But that's the same argument as \"defund the police doesn't mean defund the police\" which the Right hates. So how come the Right gets to take what Democrats say literally and criticize them for \"double-speak,\" but the Left are wrong to take the Right literally when they say \"don't teach about sexual orientation doesn't mean Don't Say Gay?\"\n\nIf the bill is meant to restrict something other than lessons that gay people literally exist, why doesn't it say so? Conservatives are claiming it seeks to prevent grooming but it doesn't say that. It implies that teachers cannot teach even that gay people exist at all. And then why shouldn't we take it one step further? \"Straight\" is a sexual orientation. Should teachers be forbidden from acknowledging their opposite-sex partners as well? Should books with married couples be banned? Clearly Republicans don't mean that. But they spend so much time making fun of Democrat double-speak only to employ similar vague, doublespeak tactics here. \n\nIt's clear that what Republicans want out of this bill is for teachers not to teach kids that they may be gay or trans. But by forbidding the discussion of these topics completely they create a kind of Streisand effect situation of gay now being a taboo thing you learn on the playground instead of the classroom, and risks creating a culture of shame and bullying against, say, the kid with two moms that the teacher isn't allowed to teach a lesson about. I don't think that's a \"deranged\" concern.","701":"13-year-old literally whores her body out for money to go see a boy band\nThis is portrayed as a good thing\n\nThere's another scene where the 13 YEAR OLD main character acts \"crass\" by literally twerking in front of her 'abusive' mom\n\nIn the film, they charge money to see her \"panda\" in the bathroom.

With just minimal effort they could have seen the raw footage of the unprovoked attacks on Kyle, the pedo shouting the n-word and death threats, and the flaming city.\n\nHowever, the theory that US funded biological weapon research in Ukraine is even more idiotic, because you don't even have to do *any* fact checking at all. All it requires is minimal thinking because it's simply so dumb on its own. No further evidence required.\n\n1. **First of all, let's look at this from the Russian perspective**. Why the hell would they initiate a slow, mass-murdering invasion with the intention of killing the guy with the finger on the button, giving him plenty of time to press it? Surely, they would have either exposed them before the invasion, staged a coup or made it their main priority to secure the weapons first.\n2. **Secondly, there's the US perspective.** It makes absolutely no sense to fund biological weapons in an active warzone with major threat of exposure from not only the Russians, but also internal corruption and the ever-increasing EU integration. Build that shit in Alaska or make a deal with an allied dictatorship in stable conditions.\n3. **Finally, you got the Ukrainian perspective.** If they actually had biological weapons or the credible threat of it, they could easily force the West to interfere if it wasn't enough to have Putin back down. The only reason we're not blasting Russians in Ukraine is due to a ridiculously small risk of a nuclear response. The threat from a man who's about to lose both his life and his country has FAR more impact.\n\nThe counter-argument that \"there are labs\" can be easily dismissed. Of course there are labs. There are labs in almost all countries. That's not the claim. The claim is that biological weapons were being developed for military purposes. Even if the development isn't finished (it never would be), the \"beta-versions\" would be plenty deadly and it wouldn't matter anyways because, all it takes is the credible threat which you'd have. And just having the program shows a willingness to use it.\n\nI can still forgive people for being dumb enough to believe this. After all, the brain turns off easily when consuming media and tribalism takes over. However, there is no way the \"anti-mainstream\" media doesn't know what they're doing. Whether it's to milk the tribalism or because of actual Kremlin interference is irrelevant. They know Moscow is lying and are happy to do their bidding. ","703":"Let's start with a quiz.

They also attempted to privatize public hospitals, but didn't manage to do it because of a corruption scandal that interrupted the plan. Their supporters and activists are openly very harsh towards poor people who get money from social programs. They call these people lazy and stupid.\n\nThe question is: which one of these parties is labeled as \"right wing\"?\n\nanswer: The first one. \n\nMy point is, the labels \"left\" and \"right\" when it comes to politics don't really have any consistent definitions. Their meaning changes depending on who's using them. They're literally useless in any kind of nuanced political analysis. They're mostly just used in simplistic \"us vs them\" statements, which means there's no actually good reason to use them.

In fact, it's usually the common talking point when people bash dating apps - \"just go out and meet people, have you not been to the gym? People did fine before dating apps existed, I meet my wife\/husband via a coffee shop transaction!\"\n\nI'm all for sending the message of 'no means no' and to not harass anyone - but saying \"don't even talk to them to begin with, they don't want to talk to you\" is sending the wrong message.\n\nThere was a post on AITA not too long ago that kind of rubbed me the wrong way - a guy was talking about how he was 'revoking an employee's opportunity because he was using it to hit on women'. Now of course being mainstream reddit he got mostly NTAs - but there were a few issues.\n\nFor one, the story never mentioned him harassing anyone or persisting after being told no - just shooting his shot and nothing else. I mean, if you're single and your work happens to give you an opportunity to meet people and you have to take an interest, then why the hell not?\n\nBut also what made the post even worse was that THE OP MENTIONED HE WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE WHO WORKED THERE. So obviously someone had to 'hit on' someone for that to happen. When I called him on that, his only argument was that \"she asked me out, I was keeping me distance\".\n\nOkay so? Why do you give HER a pass for it? I mean that's a rhetorical question and we know why (I asked him that and he never responded), but it goes to show that sometimes it will have a positive result and you'll never know unless you try. No one was saying the OP has to be a wingman, but unless he gets a complaint then he doesn't need to make it his duty to cockblock.\n\nAlso you can't be psychic and know what the result will be. People are always saying \"it's okay to get rejected\" - but clearly it's NOT okay if you're apparently doing something wrong or committing an offense by shooting your shot to begin with - particularly committing an offense if the answer ends up being no. If the answer is yes though you're in the clear. So you basically need to be psychic, it seems.\n\nThat's one nice thing about dating apps, you don't have to worry about the ditzery of 'hitting on' - but really you should be getting out there and shooting your shot, even though many keep telling you not to. Just pretend there's a secret society where it's okay and encouraged and that the message is a test to see how timid you are - because that's basically what it is.","710":"Fashion involving anthropomorphic designs are overwhelmingly very quickly pointed out and lambasted and judged ruthlessly as furry, and yet the feminine outfits (particularly French maids) with whiskers, cat ears, noses etc, often seems to get a free pass on that front.

It seems like sexuality is a bit of a spectrum and its pretty rare to only be on the edge of one side. This is because I feel like that if most men were exposed to femboys or trans women they would actually somewhat enjoy it. Sure some of them would not like it because \"Ew its a person with a penis\" which is true but that being said a lot more men then you think would probably have sex with at least one of them. After all on reddit all you see is people talk about femboys and generally those people say they are straight. I have also had personal experiences regarding this. That personal experience was when I accidentally ran into trans porn when I was 13 and having sexual feelings with it. A week after that I was turned on by full on gay stuff which leads me to believe that sexuality is more maulabile then I might have thought. I don't think its nessericaly a choice and some people are just born straight or gay but I do think to some extent most people are born somewhat in the middle and more near the straight side. This is probably why the people that wrote the bible made homosexuality a sin due to the need for breeding during those times and them seeing homosexuality in themselves and feeling shame. I do think its fine to be bi though and I would like for people to be more honest with themselves. That's what bugs me at the end of the day is people lying to themselfs.","718":"100% of these boomer conservamemes have been disproven but they'll just move the fuck on to Biden being a lizard person or something, because they have no critical thinking skills.

Unless they wore a ring I had no idea if they were married and even then unless their spouse showed up at work or something, I had no idea if they were gay or straight. I saw my teachers as just teachers, which is why if I saw them outside of school in \u201cnormal clothes\u201d and acting different than in the classroom it was always a shock to the system.\n\nNow-a-days teachers seem to be totally self-obsessed, narcissistic, and often acting like groomers.\n\n I will say right away this is obviously not true across the board, there are still teachers out there who stay objective and who are only focused on educating their students with an agenda.\n\nIf you have spent any time on social media you have probably seen how many teachers are exposing their students, children, to their sexuality, political beliefs, \u201cgender identity\u201d, and find ways to sprinkle that in anywhere they can. Because for them teaching is all about themselves, and many brag about how many LGBTQAI+ flags they have in the classroom.\n\nCurrently in Florida Democrats and teachers across the state are LOSING THEIR MINDS because they cannot talk to kindergartners through 3rd grade about sexuality and gender.  Let me repeat that, there are teachers in Florida who are furious that they can\u2019t introduce kindergartners to sex and gender.\n\nKids should be focused on math, science, writing, reading, art, and other things that will benefit them later on in life and have no political leaning if done properly. There is no reason in the world you would feel the need to talk about sex or gender with children of that age unless you are doing it for yourself, because of your own untreated mental illness that i likely being enabled by those around you, or you want to groom children too young to do basic into asking questions and thinking about things they are incapable of comprehending. \n\nNot to mention all the teachers who actively force children to wear masks to \u201cprotect themselves\u201d despite the significant damage it does to their ability to learn as well as cause all kinds of psychological issues like anxiety and depression.

I'm including this note because the whole situation fits very well with the theme of my unpopular opinion.)\n\nI'll start with an anecdote.\n\nMy high school friends come back to town. \"Hey, let's hang out,\" they say. Then, after they're back home, \"Oh, sorry we didn't have time to hang out.\"\n\nThen you learn that they did hang out with some other people. People you knew in high school, but weren't very friendly with. Your friend, however, was more friendly with these people than you were. You would have been happy to hang out with them, neutrally as generic, professional adults catching up. But this third party wouldn't want you around. Why? Because they're elitist, arrogant, narrow-minded and petty. To everyone. They really are the common denominator. They exclude a lot of people, not just me.\n\nSo, in choosing who to prioritize, me and a couple of other people, or these arrogant people, my friend(s) choose the arrogant people. Then, they lie to me to spare feelings even though I'd obviously know. In other words, they're not actually sparing my feelings, they're avoiding accountability for their social choices and expecting me to bear the full burden of my disappointment caused by their choice. Let's consider why the exclusionary, arrogant person won. In a moment.\n\nNow, a premise:\n\nIf you tell someone, \"Between one person and everyone else, who do you think is the problem, all of them, or just you?\" Who is the audience?\n\nThe Shunned Person\n\nI'm arguing that the audience is a person who is probably beautiful but a little different. I'm arguing that people are usually willing to socially excluded and punish others for the smallest reasons, since socially acceptable shunning is not considered unethical. It is actually pretty unethical, but since ethics are socially enforced, disproportionate shunning is simply not seen as a problem. Psychologists talk about disproportionate thinking.\n\nA person who is socially shunned might complain, \"Everyone hates me.\" This very common attitude is met by psychologists who say, \"Do they really hate you?\" in an effort to return to proportionate thinking. So, this person will go investigate. Maybe ask people who seem more trustworthy and empathetic, \"Why did you shun me? Do you hate me.\" The empathetic person is shocked, \"No, we don't hate you, not at all. Oh, sorry, we didn't think we were shunning you. Now that you put it that way I can see how what we did was pretty hurtful. Honestly, the vibe of the room was that a few people out of many were seemed a bit uncomfortable having you around, so we were trying to think of them.\"\n\nIf you really want to learn something, press further, \"Well why do you think that person is uncomfortable? Would they have a good reason to feel that way?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I can't think of one.\"\n\n\"So, in that case, why did you defer to them so easily, when - now that you've thought about it - your actions hurt me so much?\"\n\nAt this point, even a very empathetic person will grow at least a bit uncomfortable and not have much to say except to apologize and maybe even validate the shunned person, maybe invite them to things more proactively, but they will rarely \"go to bat\" for a person and try to push against the now prejudiced perceptions the group has. It's no their fault. These are how social dynamics work.\n\nThe Prick\n\nNow let's say the nominal social assumption about, \"It's not everyone else, it's you,\" is correct. The person being told this is a narcissistic psychopath who believes everyone in the world owes them love and that what they do, their every breath and sentence, is precious and beautiful more amazing than what anyone else does. Trying to impose themselves on everyone, demanding affection, this person is shunned. Complaining about it, they have to be informed that yes, they are the problem, not everyone else.\n\nHow often does this actually happen?\n\nThe truth is that narcissistic personality types tend to be very socially adept. Being told, \"It's not everyone else, it's you,\" would be one of the single most devastating things a narcissist can hear, and they spend most of their energy and attention being deeply engaged socially in order to avoid it.\n\nNarcissists do favors, give gifts and defer to the social cues of 80%, maybe 90% of the social environment. In most cases, they are widely liked and thought well of. They also target about 10% of the social environment as scapegoats. They use the social power they've earned through favors to turn the group against people who are easily shunned merely for standing out.\n\nThe shunned person may stand out for reasons that make them genuinely a bad fit for social life. Or, maybe the person is literally just superficially different.\n\nIn summary, the actual Prick-type will almost never expose themselves to social derision by violating social cues. They will however turn communities, rather consistently, against people just because they are noticeably different, and make and effort to shun them\n\n\"It's not everyone else, it's you\" is the \"G\" word related to lamps.\n\nSocialization isn't merely people getting along having fun. There's competition for status. There's exclusion. There's sexual competition, which can get absolutely brutal and in some communities leads to actual violence.\n\nSocial rank, especially for very socially oriented people, is the difference between whether you have to sit there and put up with listening to someone's life saga and quietly validate, or whether they owe that to you. Social rank determines who decides what the group is doing for fun. Social rank determines access to sex. Social rank in the professional world determines access to opportunities.\n\nWhen it comes to belief (religion or political ideology), social rank determines whose ego-invested belief system is validated or not.\n\nSocial rank matters, and it's no spring picnic.\n\nIt's more likely that people will be shunned because they threaten or confuse the social structure, then because they are individually a problem. Actual jerks are far more likely to be included or even elevated in the social structure - because they're important managers who are will to exclude and also enforce rank. At the very least, more jerks do well socially than there are jerks who are excluded for being jerks.\n\nReminding someone that they're a social failure, \"It's you, not them,\" will 9 times out of 10 not be directed to a villain who has deserved to be lonely and excluded. 9 times out of 10 it will be punishing and re-injuring an excluded person in order to protect the social structure, which ultimately actually protects bullies more than otherwise.\n\nIt's Toxic\n\nWhat do people think they're accomplishing by saying, \"It's not everyone else, it's you.\"\n\nThey're not showing empathy. They're not being generous. What good do they perceive they're doing? What is the purpose of them saying this.\n\nI see it most often when a person is being critical of something that has genuinely harmed them. And then someone else, for whatever reason, feels the need to prioritize the group's freedom from accountability over the harm caused to an individual. That is toxic AF.\n\nIt Really Is Everyone Else\n\n[https:\/\/nypost.com\/2019\/08\/02\/1-in-5-millennials-are-lonely-and-have-no-friends-survey\/](https:\/\/nypost.com\/2019\/08\/02\/1-in-5-millennials-are-lonely-and-have-no-friends-survey\/)\n\nOne in five millennials report having no friends.

It sucks, because I'm generous enough to overlook it. I'm generous enough to overlook the arrogance of the third party, to not bring my idiosyncratic tastes to a friendly social reunion.\n\nGenerosity and openness don't have social cache. They do matter to individuals, but you'd be HARD press to convince even an empathetic person to take social risks on behalf of even someone whom they like.\n\nThe only reason my high school friends are still in contact with me is that they personally like me. They've chosen social environments that would have nothing to do with me, so if it was up to \"everyone else\", my high school friends would cut off contact.\n\nIf I'm the common denominator, I'm liked. It's why they still have some interest. If \"everyone else\" was the common denominator, I'd be cut off.\n\nWhat we see is that, more often than not, \"everyone else\" really is the common denominator.\n\nBecause too many people, especially in American culture, simply will not risk their social standing for the sake of personal relationships, empathy or values.\n\nThat's definitely an \"everyone else\" problem, and in my opinion, people in America especially who won't admit that (for fear of appearing like a shunned person) are contributing to the problem in a big way.","728":"There are far too many people on both the far-left and far-right who believe some genuinely insane shit and should be silenced.

If you're well below 50k followers on any social media platform, it's unlikely you'll make a worthwhile income. \n\nMy submission title is a little extreme, the alternative is that it should at the very least warn creators that they may not make any significant money. \n\nI speak from experience. I'm a glamour photographer who worked with a few girls and helped them set up their OnlyFans or Patreon pages. I only did this for girls who already had a decent following, as my projections were around at least 2-4k USD per month for them. Girl A with 180k followers on Instagram was earning around 6k per month after 3 months. Girl B was at around 350k followers, she was earning upwards of 12k per month after 3 months. \n\nIn our social circle, other girls with Instagram accounts and the like noticed the money they were earning. So they signed up too. Almost nobody made any significant money, since they were all below 30k or 10k followers. \n\nI think it's important to limit accounts due to how our society currently is. Your personal and\/or professional life could be seriously crippled if you upload any pornographic content.

The tools that burglars use are just construction tools like hammers, crowbars, cutters, etc that can be found in sheds, garages, vans, pickup trucks, etc all over the country.  But given the right set of circumstances, (ie. clear intent to commit a crime), these same tools become illegal, because we really don't want to wait for a place to be broken into before we are able to prosecute someone.\n\nIn our political system, the supreme court is the safeguard against the President issuing illegal executive orders and Congress passing unconstitutional laws.  It's the equivalent of having a fence around your yard and a lock on your door to protect your property, except with the supreme court they're protecting something much more precious - your political and civil rights.\n\nSo if a political party is arguing that the supreme court not only needs to be expanded, but expanded in such a way to give themselves an immediate majority that would take decades of fair elections to overturn, then that's the political equivalent of a guy coming to the back door of your house late at night with a crowbar.

These critics would always go on about how we don't need such a military in the modern world of today, that it serves no purpose and that no such situation could arise where a military such as America kept on hand would be necessary. They would then point to Europe and say \"SEEE, these European countries barely have any military any longer and put a small fraction of resources into military compared to the US.\n\nHowever, with the situation now in Ukraine, where we are looking down the barrel of a situation where you have Russia invading Ukraine, an action that is backed by China, it is suddenly becoming apparent that this situation could expand to a level and scope that expanded well beyond Ukraine and potentially into the rest of Europe. With such a situation rearing its ugly head, I would imagine at this point all of those critics who laughed at the US for keeping such a large well-funded military must feel quite foolish now, especially those Europeans who would constantly mock the US about its military, as, if things do indeed fall apart in Europe and Russian tanks start rolling west, Europeans will unquestionably have to rely on American might in order to fend off such an attack, as most European countries sit nearly defenseless themselves against such an onslaught.\n\nIf leftists had got their way over the last several decades in the post-Cold War era, who desperately wanted the US to reign in its military size and funding and keep only a small military presence akin to what Europe does, no doubt the West would have no defense at all against any potential land war that we seem to be looking at the possibility of at this very moment. So, to all those who much such ill-informed statements over the years, I hope you all feel quite foolish now, because, like I said, if things in Europe deteriorate even further and Russia begins to charge west across Europe with the backing of China, the US will be the only thing to defend against such an action, so, I hope all those critics I mentioned above feel quite foolish now.","741":"I mean let's be honest, Russia is a superpower that rivals the US, Ukraine knows they can't win unless another nation(s) joins the war on their side.\n\nAssuming they know they're going to lose I can only come up with 2 conclusions as to why they're even fighting back:\n\n1.

If we made everyone as rich as the richest person in the world then that would go away and everyone would be simply equal. We need to print everyone as much money as Elon Musk. That way the rich can't oppress the poor and everyone is equal. Nobody has to steal or deal drugs . A more peaceful and common sense world it would be.","744":"It's also probably why it has the stigma of 'entitlement' - because everyone these days seems to believe it's synonymous with 'unreciprocated feelings' and nothing more. It's not.\n\nIt's also not a verb, it's not a thing people voluntarily 'do' to people on their volition, and in fact seeing incels use it like that is annoying and I can understand why it gets the negative rap it does.\n\nBut what it actually means (or at least originally) - is the concept that *a close friendship with someone is the -reason- they don't see you as dating material*, because you're 'too close to home' for them such that somehow intimacy would be weird and feel like incest.\n\nHence \"zone\" - a specific point where their closeness is somehow mutually exclusive to the other kind of closeness. Or just straight up the idea that friendship in general is mutually exclusive to intimacy. And yes, as dumb as that sounds, that's what it means.\n\n\nSo, these days when someone is rejected by someone they recently met, it's silly and wrong to say that they were \"friendzoned\" or \"in their friendzone\" - because there was never a friendship to be had to begin with, they barely know them.\n\nNow, whether that's actually a thing and the people in question actually do have people they feel that way about, is up for debate - since it could just be that they're simply not into them regardless and it has nothing to do with their 'friendship'.\n\nBut whether it's true or not, generally the idea is that being friends with someone is what's primarily contributing to hurting the possibility of being seen as date material. Or in simpler terms, the idea that an *existing friendship* is somehow a dealbreaker.\n\nBut, either way, the reasons people believe that and partly why the concept came to be, I'd say are pretty valid even if they're based on a misunderstanding - a valid misunderstanding.\n\nIt's usually because often when people start dating in their younger years - or trying to - when they get rejected they'll often hear things like:\n\n\"I see you more as a friend.\"\n\n\"I think we'd get along better as friends\"\n\n\"You're a bit close and I feel like things wouldn't be the same if we dated\"\n\n\"But... we're friends\"\n\n\"You're like a brother\/sister to me\"\n\nSee the pattern? It's only natural that once a large number of people hear that regularly, it would send the message that it's their *friendship* or the type of relationship they cultivate with people that hurts them in the field somewhere along the way - I mean, logically it would make sense to draw that conclusion, no? So yeah naturally they will shy away from befriending people they're into and just go for it as an all-or-nothing approach, since they'll associate 'friendship'\/siblinghood as something mutually exclusive to being a partner - because, well, that's basically what they're repeatedly told - that it's the friendship that's the dealbreaker.\n\nBut then again, there's also the possibility that despite a large enough sample size of people mentioning friendship when rejecting someone, all those lines about friendship and siblinghood and closeness were just sugarcoating platitudes and they're just straight up not into them, for reasons completely unrelated to their approach in the relationship they cultivated and it has nothing to do with that. After all, lots of times people start dating after having already known each other for years. So clearly \"friendship\" isn't always a mutually exclusive dealbreaker. A lot of the time also people develop feelings they didn't have before.\n\nAnd sure, maybe some have people they actually do feel that way about and their closeness really is what would be a dealbreaker if the idea were to be floated. After all, sometimes you'll hear secondhand gossip like \"Damn, I can't believe John asked me out... he's like a brother to me\". Which is an indicator that it's a little more than 'letting someone down easy' - since they're saying it about someone when they're not around, rather than to their face. But again, it could just be that they still straight up aren't into John and never would have been regardless of their 'siblinghood', and just feel guilty about that and are using that to self-rationalize that mentally. Who knows.\n\nBut either way, whether it's real or not, the bottom line is that it has nothing to do with 'entitlement'. It's just a social perception and nothing more.\n\nPlus, when you're going with this definition (rather than the incel definition), someone who \"has someone in their friendzone\" isn't even seen as a bad person with malicious intentions. But rather, it means that THEY fucked up themselves in their approach somewhere along the way and landed themselves in said 'zone'.","745":"[removed]","746":"I am not saying charity is bad.

Good habits start in childhood.  If parents educate their children on healthy eating and teach them to avoid industrialized meat that is ladened with hormones and antibiotics, as well as corn syrup- which is far more dangerous than cane sugar, and caffiene-- which is the most abused drug in the world, we'll all be much healthier and our collective healthcare costs will be much lower.  \n\nI agree that the most serious problem facing the Western world is the barbaric practice of circumcision, but we should also restrict the right of parents to feed children toxic-- yet culturally acceptable-- commodities like industrialized meat, corn syrup and caffeine. \n\nWe should also prohibit parents from permitting their children to engage in sports that have high incidents of head trauma.  There is no reason why anybody should play football, soccer or gymnastics other than that they are cultural artifacts.  There's no biological or innate need to play these sports.  Considering how often children are injured while playing these games, they should be banned.\n\nCultural familiarity and tradition should not be an excuse to allow parents to make poor and dangerous decisions for their children.\n\nI propose that we develop a panel of experts to review all of our cultural elements and traditions to determine which ones are dangerous and undesirable.  Then we can use the power of the state to eliminate the undesirable traditions.  We can call this process the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward.

Of all Democrat voters polled:\n\n* 59% favor a government policy requiring that citizens remain confined to their homes at all times, except for emergencies, if they refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n* 48% think federal and state governments should be able to fine or imprison individuals who publicly question the efficacy of the existing COVID-19 vaccines on social media, television, radio, or in online or digital publications. \n\n* 45% favor governments requiring citizens to temporarily live in designated facilities or locations if they refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n* 47% favor a government tracking program for those who won\u2019t get the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n* 29% support temporarily removing parents\u2019 custody of their children if parents refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine\n\nIt also says:\n\n> __President Biden\u2019s strongest supporters are most likely to endorse the harshest punishments against those who won\u2019t get the COVID-19 vaccine.__ \n\nSo where does the Ukraine fit into this?  Well according to [this wikipedia article](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/COVID-19_vaccination_in_Ukraine), Ukraine is a country of vaccine skeptics.\n\n* Two polls were held asking people if they intended to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.  In the first poll (Jun 2021), 43% said no, and in the second (Aug 2021), 56% said no.\n\n* By September 2021, Ukraine's official fully vaccinated rate was only 18%.  By comparison, neighboring countries like Slovakia and Poland were already at 40-50%.\n\n* In October 2021, the interior minister reported that Ukraine was \"drowning in forged vaccination certificates\" in response to Europe's digital vaccination requirement.  (Read more [here](https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/ukraines-fake-vaccine-certificate-black-145808248.html)).\n\n* At this point it is impossible to know how many people in the Ukraine have been fully vaccinated (because of the rampant fraud), but even the most official \/ optimistic sources place the number at 50% of the adult population.\n\nWith that in mind, I believe that Putin made a significant strategic error by not justifying his invasion of the Ukraine using their vaccine skepticism, the fact that at least half of the adult population remains unvaccinated, and the country's significant problem with fake vaccine certificates, because if he had, many Democrats, including Biden's strongest supporters, would have supported it.","799":"To me right now Russia is equivalent to Nazi Germany trying to murder Jews. \n\nIf the Jews had an option to surrender and not be murdered they would have taken it.

I'm not a real man.\n\nA: OMG YOU CAN'T SAY THAT, THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS, REEEEE\n\nI think the idea of non-binary gender is kind of weird, since most of the time it seems to be just people defining their personality traits and personal style as a separate gender. However, the idea of gender being rigidly linked with certain personality traits and appearance is a conservative idea. Non-binary people are only going along with it.\n\nEvery time someone with traditional views about gender said something about how a \"real man\" (or \"real woman\") acts in a certain way, dresses in a certain way, etc. they were creating a foundation for the idea that some people aren't really male or female, but something else. Therefore, if you have a guy who, for example, likes to paint his nails, then that conservative view would separate him from \"real maleness\", and that logically creates another gendered category that isn't either male or female. \n\ndisclaimer: this has nothing to do with gender dysphoria, which is a totally separate thing, a medical issue that's treated with a transition","817":"Pretty much every normal person who was on the right several years ago has either left the right, or has radicalized into something completely different because of what the modern right has become. The modern right has become hostile and uninviting unless you were already primed for it, and that is what I think lead to many more people voting for Biden then Trump.\n\nThere was a time when the right portrayed themselves as rational, even if they weren't. These people thought that they were doing things out of scientific rationality. The modern right however is built on manufacturing outrage and hysteria, Anti-CRT and Anti-Vaccine ideologies are a perfect embodiment of this, built completely on manufactured outrage.\n\nMany Americans had seen how Trump had ruined the US especially when COVID-19 came around. To your normal everyday American, it was becoming more obvious day-by-day how insane the right was once Trump's idiotic actions lead to huge death tolls and inspired his base of gullible supporters to common-sense defying actions just because Trump or one of his elites supported them.\n\nWhen Biden won the election, many Trump supporters believe (and still believe to this day) that Biden committed election fraud despite there being no solid evidence, hell you could probably find more evidence that Trump committed election fraud considering the past collisions with Russia and him even thinking of that \"voter fraud\" idea in the first place. It is likely pure projection on Trump's part.\n\nThe people of the US has elected Biden despite potential election fraud by Trump's side and despite Trump's futile attempts to stay in power. It was because normal people were becoming increasingly frustrated with the right and the death toll that had accumulated under Trump's reign.","818":"[deleted]","819":"Comparing covid lockdowns to laws against drink driving is a false equivalency for a multitude of reasons.\n\n1: Laws against drink driving do no violate established civil liberties. They do not impact freedom of expression, freedom of movement, the right to a speedy trial, the right to be free from searches without a warrant or the right to work. The same can't be said about lockdowns.\n\n2: Laws against drink driving are limited in scope. They only require somebody to refrain from drink driving. Lockdowns impact most if not all aspects of a person's life. They impact the person  both socially and economically and in so many other ways.\n\n3: Laws against drink driving do not cause harm. Although not being able to drive home while drunk may be annoying, the benefits of not driving home drunk absolutely outweigh downsides. Lockdowns cause widespread harm to society including social, psychological and economic harm. This harm disproportionately harms the most disadvantaged and vulnerable members of society.\n\n4: Laws against drink driving achieve their intended purpose. Laws against drink driving do in fact save lives and are supported by science. Lockdowns save little to no lives and are not backed by science. Every pandemic plan prior to covid-19 opposed lockdowns and current studies are showing that they have slim to none impact on saving lives from covid-19.\n\n5: It is more difficult to use laws against drink driving as a political weapon. Lockdown rules can easily be used to target and shut down political groups and movements. This is seen in both third world countries and in western countries as well. For example, Victorian Premier Dan Andrews shutting down the entire construction industry to punish them for a protest and the Chinese government using covid restrictions to restrict the travel of political dissidents.\n\n6: Laws against drink driving are proportional to the threat of drunk drivers and there doesn't seem to be any viable alternatives to laws against drink drivers. Lockdowns are disproportionate  to the threat of covid-19. Although covid-19 can make people from some demographics very sick, it doesn't pose a serious threat to the average person. We also have some vaccines that can reduce the severity of the disease. Focused protection is not just a viable alternative to lockdowns, it also saves lives unlike lockdowns.","820":"I will be speaking about the situation in United States here. Hatred against transgender people is usually justified with a few different methods. Supposedly being trans is not Christian, it\u2019s a choice, it\u2019s a sexual deviancy, it\u2019s body mutilation. None of these arguments have any basis at all. They are just unfounded claims. Anti LGBTQ propaganda comes in and takes advantage of a lack of study into the topic. If you would like me to explain how being transgender isn\u2019t a baseless claim I will. From multiple MRI scan studies it has been discovered transgender people have brains matching their gender identity, rather than their genitalia identity. I am willing to further discuss the topic without hostility if anyone would like to.\nEdit: typo","821":"You heard me.

If it was not for reproduction, penises and vaginas would not have existed in the first place. So SEXual organs, SEX, etc, is connected to reproduction.\n\nYou can not reproduce with \"oral\" or \"anal\" sex, therefore those are NOT sex.\n\nMore so, those are stupid and make no sense. First because you'd want to save your semen to ejaculate in a vagina, so it's against your own reproductive interest to waste it, second because vaginal sex is 1000x times better than \"anal\" or \"oral\" sex. Also, why would you put your penis inside a disgusting hole where feces come out and why would you put your penis in a mouth, where teeth are? Even if the woman is very skilled, it's still nowhere near the sensation of PIV sex.\n\nLast but not least, oral sex was not even popular at all until very recently, as it was popularized by degenerate porn. Anal sex even less so.\n\nIf such behavior was normal or productive, it would be observed throughout nature. It's not. Before you link me those couple of exceptions, know i am up to date that many are not even actual \"oral\"\/\"anal\" sex, just grooming, that most have been observed in captivity to begin with.\n\nDownvote away because this is a *very popular opinion*, as you have done with my other topic on masturbating not making sense.","824":"Winsome Sears is the only female politician I would support as a presidential candidate. \n\nWinsome Sears is a complete badass, and I think she would make a great first female president (though sex doesn't affect the office and shouldn't matter). \n\nSears is a great example of strong leadership in the face of systemic adversity - especially the White privileged Left who totally ignored her political victory, while simultaneously seeking to continually suppress conservative people of color, especially women.\n\nI also like Candace Owens, and I think she would make a much better VP than coattails Harris. They are the only team of women involved in politics I would support.\n\nAmerica needs to stop shitting on political Black women like these amazing ladies.\n\nSears also hasn't shown blatant anti-Semitic hatred or hatred via silence like high profile *Democrat* female politicians, such as Omar, Tlaib or Clinton.","825":"[removed]","826":"[deleted]","827":" Psychological exams arn't a machine that automatically detects crazy its  just a series a question.

Many unvaccinated people are simply misinformed and have concerns about the vaccine. Like any other medical procedure, it's not unreasonable to want clarity that what you are putting in your body is safe. \n\nEach unvaccinated person is different and has different reasons for refusing the vaccine. Some of these reasons are totally understandable. I can't blame Aboriginal Australians for not wanting the vaccine given horrific atrocities committed against them by the Australian government. Not wanting the vaccine because someone you know had a bad reaction is also understandable.\n\nContrary to popular belief, most of the unvaccinated would be open to getting the vaccine if their concerns were addressed. To those who argue that the unvaccinated 'can't be reasoned with', maybe the reason they weren't listening to you is because you were insulting them and acting in a condescending way.\n\nAlso to note, disadvantaged communities such as low income, POC and immigrants have lower vaccination rates and worse health outcomes in general. These groups often struggle more with accessing correct information and have less contact with healthcare professionals. \n\nAlso, calling someone stupid for being misinformed isn't productive. It doesn't achieve anything other than making them not listen to you. What you should do is present them with the correct information in a calm, intelligent and non condescending manner. They aren't nessecerily stupid, they are misinformed. \n\nTreat it like sex ed. We don't get angry at a teenager who is misinformed about sex? We give them the right information. We don't call them stupid and refuse to explain things. When a pregnant woman is making a decision that could negatively affect her child, we counsel and educate that women and we ask her why she is making the harmful decision and her concerns.\n\nIt would be a good idea to invite these people to seminars where they can ask questions about the vaccine without being judged. Have people they trust and can relate to such as community leaders promote the vaccine instead of untrustworthy politicians and burocrats and elitist celebrities. \n\nThe person promoting vaccination should also not have any known political affiliation. These people are open to getting vaccinated. They just need assurance and the right information. Coercion on the other hand is both unethical and counterproductive. \n\nCoercion is a violation of civil liberties and sets a bad precedent which will affect other bodily autonomy issues such as the right to abortion, the autonomy of pregnant women, blood donation, organ donation and forced psychiatry. It also makes people feel violated and this causes distrust in doctors and the medical system which leads to poorer long term health outcomes.","830":"It should be at the bottom while id like this mentality to apply world wide, im focusing mainly on canada. What I mean is, if you want to pray, if it doesn't violate any other laws, then of course you can pray. But when stuff like vaccine exceptions are being made because of religion, that should be a no no. If personal beliefs allow you to opt out, then everyone should be able to. \n\nmy view is that exceptions should not be made on the grounds of religion. If your religion dictates you violate employment laws then no, you should get a pass. \nNo accommodation should be made for religious people unless they show proof that it will cause them undue stress. But they must go through the process of mental health same as anyone. You can't just claim that you have mental health issues and skip class. you need a doctors note. Churches should not get exemption on taxes just for being churches but must show proof of charity work. (Same goes for mosques, temples etc) \n\nI don't buy the argument that people say its cultural. I would love to have Chinese new year off but because its not religion it doesn't get a pass. And thats fine by me if its symmetrical.\n\nPoint being, religion should be the last law. All laws and policies should override the freedom of religion.

Obviously, if we consider that logic, then we could come to the conclusion that the person wearing the clothes is dumb, or stupid to do it (because in their minds they think that's why they got assaulted). however, that doesn't excuse the rapist, because they are taking advantage of a 'dumb' person. no matter how you look at it, the perpetrator is always at fault. so what confuses me is why do they get angry at someone for being dumb, and not someone who is taking advantage of someone dumb. \n\nand if any of you guys say \"oH BuT tHey mUsT haVe WanTeD iT iF tHey dreSeD lIkE thAt.\" then i will do nothing probably. anyways the victim said no in the process, so why the fuck did the person continues. \n\nTL;DR: if we follow the conservatives thinking of a rape victims clothing is the cause for the rape, and thus the victim is dumb, then we should still get angry at the rapist for raping someone (aka taking advantage of a \"dumb\" person).","837":"It is bad and outdated.

Nominalist, positivistic, materialistic, aristocratic, anarchist, what?\n\nHe don't give any argummentation about his philosophy, it's just cultural critique of a sad man, and anger about his mom.His vision about religion is idiotic, and his framework of the superman is just turning back the clock to tribalism and unnecessary violence. If you like Nietzsche, you like things as murder, torture, pillage and political oppression of the weak by the strong. And he says this explicitly, as in his *\"Genealogy of morals\"*, as i quote:\n\n*\"And we are the first to admit that anyone who knew these \"good\" ones only as enemies would find them evil enemies indeed. For these same men who, amongst themselves, are so strictly constrained by custom, worship, ritual, gratitude, and by mutual surveillance and jealousy, who are so resourceful in consideration, tenderness, loyality, pride and friendship, when once they step outside their circle become little better than uncaged beasts of prey. Once abroad in the wilderness, they revel in the freedom from social constraint and compensate for their long confinement in the quietude of their own community. They revert to the innocence of wild animals: we can imagine them returning from an orgy of murder, arson, r\\*pe, and torture, jubilant and at peace with themselves as though they had committed a fraternity prank\"*( censure by me).\n\nSecond, his ethics is just moronic. He tries to construct a virtue ethics but without a solid teleology and  sees the agent as a just of junction of impulses and social constructs to impress people. He even shouts things like this: \n\n*\" The astral order in which we live is an exception; this order and the considerable duration that is conditioned by it have again made possible the exception of exceptions: the development of the organic. The total character of the world, by contrast, is for all eternity chaos, not in the sense of a lack of necessity but of a lack of order, organization, form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever else our aesthetic anthropomorphisms are called. Judged from the vantage point of our reason, the unsuccessful attempts are by far the rule; the exceptions are not the secret aim, and the whole musical mechanism repeats eternally its tune, which must never be called a melody - and ultimately even the phrase 'unsuccessful attempt' is already an anthropomorphism bearing a reproach. But how could we reproach or praise the universe! Let us beware of attributing to it heartlessness or unreason or their opposites: it is neither perfect, nor beautiful, nor noble, nor does it want to become any of these things; in no way does it strive to imitate man! In no way do   our aesthetic and moral judgements apply to it! It also has no drive to self-preservation or any other drives; nor does it observe any laws. Let us beware of saying that there are laws in nature. There are only necessities: there is no one who commands, no one who obeys, no one who transgresses. Once you know that there are no purposes, you also know that there is no accident; for only against a world of purposes does the word 'accident' have a meaning. Let us beware of saying that death is opposed to life. The living is only a form of what is dead, and a very rare form. Let us beware of thinking that the world eternally creates new things. There are no eternally enduring substances; matter is as much of an error as the god of the Eleatics. 1 But when will we be done with our caution and care? When will all these shadows of god no longer darken us? When will we have completely de-deified nature? When may we begin to naturalize humanity with a pure, newly discovered, newly redeemed nature?\"* As Pablo Olmedo wroted ( my translation): *\"a priori structures are not ahistorical and independent of sensitivity, if the organization of our reason is variable, in the sense that it is subject to a development process, it is not possible to affirm the need to think the bodies organic from the consideration according to final cause\".*\n\nSee this guy as he really was: the founder of the descontructionist and woke rethoric of facts don\u00b4t existing and: \"all that exists are power plays\".

Nowadays, when suffering is invariably quoted as the chief argument against existence, it might be well to recall the days when matters were judged from the opposite point of view; when people would not have missed for anything the pleasure of inflicting suffering, in which they saw a powerful agent, the principal inducement to living. By way of comfort to the milksops, I would also venture the suggestion that in those days pain did not hurt as much as it does today; at all events, such is the opinion of a doctor who has treated Negroes for complicated internal inflammations which would have driven the most stoical Europeans to distraction -- the assumption here being that the negro represents an earlier phase of human development\"*.\n\nOr here: \n\n*\"For my part, I am convinced that, compared with one night's pain endured by a hysterical bluestocking, all the suffering of all the* [*animals*](https:\/\/www.friesian.com\/moral-1.htm#animal) *that have been used to date for scientific experiments is as nothing.\"*\n\nSo many great thinkers of this period of time( Lortz, Brownie, Boutroux, Schiller, Kikergaard) and people read and love this stupid moron?

As far as I am concerned, that should have been the end of it.\n\nNow is the part of the story that we are expected to believe but makes absolutely no sense: she was still confused as to whether she was still on probation, so she went to the Department of Corrections to state that she felt there was a possibility that court had given her the incorrect information, and now, a Department of Corrections officer told her she was no longer on probation, was now able to vote, and was given paperwork to demonstrate it. At this point, she filed to reinstate her voter registration, and is now sentenced to prison for 6 years for voter fraud and trying to vote while a convicted felon. She now claims she was not made aware that she was not allowed to vote, especially since she had not been formally removed from the voter registry beforehand. \n\nIf she did not know that she was unable to vote, she would not have gone through the entire process to reinstate her voting registration. Does she think we were all born yesterday? \n\nI do believe that someone in the Department of Corrections provided her false information. I do not believe that she was actually confused as to whether she was still on probation. 2015 to 2019 is 4 years, out of the 7 for which she was on probation. When sentenced, you are informed of the civil liberties that are taken from you at the time. I think she went to the Department of Corrections knowing she was on probation, hoping that the clerk would be persuaded by her story and not do their due diligence to confirm otherwise (which is exactly what happened).\n\nNow, do I think 6 years in prison is excessive? Yes. She may be given the opportunity after 9 months of good behavior to just go back on probation for an extended period of time, which I would say is on the LENIENT side. And there is a conversation to be had as to whether or not felons should lose their right to vote. But do I believe her story?

While there are a small subset of vegans who do that, it is very hypocritical for anti-vegans to say that because they are doing the exact same thing but even worse.

I know lots of perfectly reasonable religious people. Majority don't believe or interpret the stories and mythology as factual and think humans wrote them. The ones that do tend to have cognitive dissonance and we just don't talk about it. Many just find it to be a framework for how to live life, to be used along side current cultural norms and laws. And I enjoy many parts to religion, weather it is philosophy, art, charity, history, and architecture. Ultimately I think live and let live, provided they aren't hurting anyone. This goes for other forms of belief aside from religion too (like extreme nationalism and other forms of tribalism). I hope there is something after death as it would just be more desirable, I just don't think it is logical and am content with what ever happens.  \n\n\nWith that out of the way. There is most likely aliens out there somewhere in our universe. We don't have the largest sample to go by for planets, but it would still seem like it would be statistically impossible for there not to be. We can find important precursors to life in random places and on meteors too (Adenine for example, a nucleotide base in DNA, RNA, and part of ATP). The universe is unfathomably vast, with trillions and trillions of stars, and based on experiments on Earth that mimic early Earth conditions (Miller-Urey experiment), the formations of these precursor to life molecules seem to be inevitable. There are bound to be places out there that mimic conditions here. But with all the extremophile organisms here, life could also thrive in extreme conditions out there.  \n\n\nScientologists believe an alien dude brought members from his overpopulated planet here and killed them in volcanoes, brainwashed their souls, for their souls to travel around and bind to the primitive people back them. Aliens are most likely out there somewhere, but all the major religions require there to be souls\/ghosts anyways, so that is one outlandish thing Scientology has in common.  \n\n\nGod is unlikely (not impossible). If we use Occam's razor, either:  \n1- The universe has always existed in some form, weather a singularity or earlier universe before the big bang (simplest explanation).  \n2- The universe was created out of nothing during the big bang (requires an extra step, less simple).  \n3- Some all knowing, all powerful creature\/creatures has existed in some form always, and they decided to make the universe out of nothing (requires the most extra steps, therefore is less simple).  \n\n\nIf we look at instincts such as the desire to survive, we can deduce why every culture wants and believes there is an afterlife. Other instincts like forming hierarchical structures, we can see why some being would be placed on top. And if we just think about how a human with these instincts would try to interpret the world around them (why we exist etc) we can see why belief systems such as creationism, monotheism, pantheism, and animism came about. So the fact that every culture believes in some of the same things is nothing special.  \n\n\nIf we look at people's stories about dyeing on the operating table, we see differences based on cultural beliefs, inconsistencies where people who are good but think they are bad go to hell, but bad people who think they are good go to heaven (in the most objective form of good and bad cross culture, like serial murderers and child rapists). We also run into the issue where people aren't declared dead with the same criteria everywhere. In the past and in developing nations, it was when your heart stopped. In other parts its when parts of your brain shut down, in much of the developed world, it's once you are brain dead (though you can be a living braindead husk attacked to machinery). In the end it is pretty much when you pass the point where we can revive you. We also have the issue of trusting a failing and dyeing brain. If those experiences count as evidence, why not a schizophrenics delusions or a psychedelic experience? But I digress.\n\nI know religion bashings is popular on Reddit, but it seems far more acceptable to rip on Scientologists or UFO cults in every day life than to make fun of any major religion.  \n\n\nTLDR: Scientology and UFO cults are more plausible than every other major religion because statistically it is likely there are aliens out there in the vast expanse of space. Both require the existence of souls so they are even there. But a giant, all knowing and all powerful being(s) that exists outside of space and time, creating the universe out of nothing seems highly unlikely if not impossible. As for everything else in religious books, it just serves as further evidence against the accuracy of those religions if you take it for face value and literally.\n\nEdit: Not to be a karma whore, but remember that downvoting would mean this is a popular opinion.","896":"Casual dating\/sex is about having a mutually good time.

Same with rape or automobile incidents.

If there\u2019s any argument here it\u2019s that they\u2019re merely the reapers while the people in charge of making the laws (y\u2019know, the ones that say \u201cimprison the people for smoking a joint\u201d) are the devils. \n\n3. Then there\u2019s the argument of corruption. \n\nAccording to Google there\u2019s 17,985 US police agencies at all levels of governing: local, county, state, and federal. You cannot fairly identify \u201call cops as bastards\u201d when there\u2019s so many separate agencies that really don\u2019t have much to do with each other in my opinion. \n\n4. Then there\u2019s the alleged racism.\n\nI really don\u2019t like that argument much either. Again going back to numbers, there\u2019s over 700,000 policemen (that essentially mirror the demographics of the US) in over 17,000 departments. I don\u2019t see how we can fairly define one or even a few cops.\n\n5. And lastly was the argument of abuse: the 40% of cops studies (they allege that 40% of cops are abusive spouses). This one is the best argument I saw but I don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s a great argument.\n\nThe \u201c40%\u201d cops studies were both done in the early 1990\u2019s by an organization that was intentionally critical of policing.\n\nI\u2019m not going to try to disprove the statistics or anything, but the studies do deserve a second look.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t even indicate any real problem that policing itself causes. Rather that policing has certain kinds of people, in particular men, that join the force and these men usually are a lot more physically aggressive than men in other professions.\n\nTLDR: common anti police arguments, while important, I feel are either unfair to police or have significant flaws that prevent them from being strong.","899":"If the government can break into your home at any time and use the excuse that you were holding a gun in your own house as a reason to murder you then the 2nd amendment is a joke.

And this goes with videogames, shows and everything else involving the internet. If the time was always just announced in GMT then people would only have to know their own time zone and GMT. I I'm not against normal time zones. Like obviously they should exist for business and geographical purposes but people on the internet should just use GMT as a way of communicating to avoid confusion. For instance during the Olympics, you wouldn't have to convert between China or Japan time but the times would simply be announced in GMT so everyone could understand and instantly convert.

They've got a competent rhythm section in John and Roger, and Freddie is a great vocalist but the kind of music they made always seemed so subdued and borderline wussy. Brian May didn't really have any memorable guitar solos and Under Pressure is one of the most annoying songs ever written. I don't know how him and Bowie listened back at that and said \"Yeah that sounds not whiney and annoying.\"","955":"Of course, some people will weigh the pros and cons. I know a lot of people still think the benefits are great, but I think that only applies to wealthy and educated people. If you are not so wealthy, in a divorce case, your partner who is more wealthy can hire a better lawyer. \n\nFor a lot of people who make more money, however, they may still lose out a lot. If a man makes a million dollars a year and had 9 million in savings, while the wife had 10k in her bank account, in a divorce, even if it isn't 50\/50, one year or even a few years later, she gets part of it. \n\nDon't get me started on alimony. I think alimony should only exist if both had agreed one stays home and raise the kids. But even then, I think it's not a good idea. No one should stay home and raise kids but instead work. If you can't afford to hire a nanny, I think for your sake you shouldn't have kids. The reason is, what happens if the man doesn't pay you alimony? What if he leaves the country? What if he turns abusive and you must flee with the kids? In my opinion, all parents, male or female should think of this. A marital partner should be an addition that is nice to have, but not your better half. (Yes, this is unpopular opinions.) I think the idea that marriage is codependency is very bad. We should instill in children more to be self reliant.\n\nI just don't get why we are so obsessed with getting married and defining what marriage 'is'. Like a lot of people still think a contract must last a lifetime. Why? If someone doesn't want to, that's their business. I think if you want it to last a lifetime, have a clause. Like 'if it lasts at least 20 years, even in divorce, you get half of our financial assets. Otherwise if less than 20 years, you get nothing'.

In my history of using YouTube, I\u2019ve almost never trusted dislikes on a YouTube video. When I\u2019ve needed to DIY or look something up, I can tell based on the quality of the production, number of views, and (most commonly) the state of the comments. I\u2019ve always ignored the likes AND dislikes because people use dislikes on YouTube the same way they use downvotes on Reddit. Most often, people use dislikes and downvotes as \u201cdisagree buttons\u201d and not because of the content of the post or comment. Hell it\u2019s half the reason this sub is filled with posts that most people don\u2019t find controversial or unpopular at all.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I agree they did it for shitty reasons. To protect their ad income and manipulate how they sell \u201cviews\u201d. I\u2019m not disputing that. That being said, I would bet that many Reddit users that suddenly care so passionately about removing dislikes hardly ever paid any attention to them at all.","957":"[removed]","958":"Here are some trends that I am seeing from casually watching 80s documentaries:\n- The woman is usually pregnant before the marriage\n- There is a \"European fantasy\" element to the wedding\n- The guy is usually extremely abusive, but she feels that he'll \"change\" and ignores obvious red flags like asking her if she's Jewish for whatever reason\n- He doesn't change and she goes back to her mother's place\n\nBefore you say that this is all conjecture, the rates of single mothers and so on have shot up drastically from the 80s. I think that this is a common theme that all of us can attest to in our lives. I think that 80s nostalgia prevents us from seeing how much our parents' generation sucked because \"muh Stranger Things.\"\n\nHere are a few plausible causes that I can think about:\n- Princess Diana's wedding made \"commoners\" think that they were actually billionaires on hard times and a prince was coming to \"save\" them if they just \"behaved right\"\n- The depressions of the 70s were pushed out in favour of forced 80s positivity, which made many women overlook abuse\n- It was an extremely strong trend for every woman to have blonde hair, which would have distanced women even more from other minorities and pushed them deeper into this \"European exceptionalism\" role\n- As we all know, MTV manipulated the charts and destroyed music, often putting on trite boy-meets-girl music with no substance (music is a way of flexing the brain for children and, when no substance is given, nothing is learned)\n- Women were determined not to marry because many of these parents divorced in the 60s and 70s during the 'free love' period\n- There was a weird sex negativity at the time that might have contributed to this. All of the 80s women that I've talked to are extremely frigid and uptight like little girls. I wish that I was making this up. When I look back at historical figures from the 80s like Princess Diana, this seems to be a cultural thing. Something shifted from the 'free love' of the 70s to, \"Oh, no. Sex bad. I'm a sweet, innocent virgin with 3 kids out of wedlock\"\n\nWhat I want to know is what could make a rational, logical person fall for this stuff. Is it just the lack of internet and predominance of watered-down MTV and reality shows like The Cosby Show being the only type of education? What's going on here?","959":" In general, I do not care about economics or war or trading or whatever the hell that politicians do in the White House. As long as I can live my life without government caused events interrupting me, then I will never care about politics.\n\nThe only reason a lot of people seem to care about politics is because things like race, lgbt+, misogyny, mental\/physical disabilities, and things of the sort are treated as political. Every human being, no matter how different they are, deserves a basic amount of respect and rights. That is something that everyone just needs to hurry and agree on.\n\nLGBT+ are people. If you don't like them, you treat them the same as you would treat a cis\/straight person you dislike: You ignore them, you move on with your own life.\n\nMinorities should be able to just exist in the media without people calling out how \"woke\" and \"forced\" something is. And the exact same thing goes for people with disabilities, whether physical or mental.\n\nWomen should be able to choose the things they want to do and to feel safe in society without being told that they want to \"kill all men\" or they're just being selfish. Feminism was originally about CHOICE. It was originally for a woman to be able to choose her own path in life. Not whatever is happening on Twitter. It was originally to let men know that we feel uncomfortable with constant, un-asked for sexual comments.\n\n\\-----\n\nBut unfortunately, if you talk about feminism now, you're called a 'Karen' by conservatives who don't even know the original definition for 'Karen' in the first place.\n\nAnd if you say \"You know what? Gay people are people too, and they should probably be treated nicely :)\", you're called a 'Libtard'? For what? For acknowledging that different people still deserve respect? No one is hurting you personally, so why care so much about a gay person is up to?\n\nIf you say anything about race, mostly conservatives will say some weird stuff like \"Why complain so much? There are successful black people today.\" Are you stupid? There were successful minorities during the peak of the civil rights movement, and even before that!\n\nDid a small group of rich minorities stop the police from beating people in the streets during marches? Did a small group of rich minorities stop little black boys from being shot at simply for being black? And did a small group of rich minorities singlehandedly stop the growing poverty amongst most of the minorities in the U.S? You can apply this same logic to rich white folks today. Trump's family has been rich for decades. But does that suddenly increase the income in white lower-income families? Does Harry Style's wealth all of a sudden find a perfect home for poor white students who can't afford their own?\n\n\\-----\n\nI do realize that because of the history regarding these subjects, they are deemed as 'political'. I really do understand.\n\nBut it just sucks so much that if you just think all types of humans deserve basic respect\/rights, the right is just so quick to call you out? Human rights should NOT be political in any way! And if human rights weren't so political then I would be totally neutral on the subject of politics.\n\nEven if you don't label yourself as 'liberal' or 'left', as soon as you talk about the above subjects, you are called a 'libtard' and made fun of.

To them it's just another word that means bad. Like when they erroneously call people communists or socialists, without even knowing that those words aren't interchangeable. Someone pointed out that their favored political candidate is extraordinarily racist human being, so in response they play the \"no you\" card. They don't really have an opinion that goes any deeper than \"Red good, blue bad\".\n\n**Edit: I have no problem whatsoever with people downvoting or disagreeing with me.

I mean, what could be cooler than squaring off against the Soviet tanks, MIGs, subs, short-range nuclear missiles, etc to hold off a Soviet invasion of western Europe?\n\nBut, times change, I'm older, the Soviet Union is long gone, many of the post-Soviet states have joined the EU, and NATO ....  well apparently NATO doesn't get CNN and didn't see the Berlin Wall come down because otherwise they would have declared victory and closed up shop 30 years ago.\n\nAnd yet NATO is still around, and now they have a brand new mission  - defend post-Soviet states from other post-Soviet states.  So for example if Kazakhstan wants to invade Tajikistan, the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe will be like \"**NOT ON MY WATCH**\" and light them the fuck up. Why?   Nobody knows.\n\nIf you've studied any history at all, then you know that Europe's recent lack of conflict is a historical aberration.  You've heard of the hundred years war, right?  Since it was in Europe, it went sixteen extra years.  But that's nothing compared to, for example, the Roman wars with Persia, or the Crusades, which went on for more than 600 years.  If you want to see your scroll bar shrink to a micron, check out this wikipedia page:  [List of Conflicts in Europe](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_conflicts_in_Europe)\n\nBottom line is that the US spent the 20th century fighting in and defending Europe, and all we have to show for it is the anti-American EU and its smug VAT-paying supplicants who lecture us about politics, health care, etc at every opportunity.  The best time for us to wash our hands of Europe would have been 100 years ago, and the second best time is right now.  Maybe now's a good time to pay attention to our own hemisphere so we don't end up with another Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, or Pablo Escobar.\n\nAnd besides, the promise of the EU was to keep the peace in Europe, and guess what, here is a great opportunity for you folks and it's practically in your own backyard.

Let's go through the actions of Cersei and see if the sum of her actions and personality can be characterized as evil. \n\n**Season** 1\n\n\\- Her influence on Jaime pushing Bran out of a tower. \n\nIt is difficult to know whether she truly wanted Jaime to push Bran as she didn't say so explicitly. But lets even assume she did want that, while the action is undoubtedly gruesome is it truly evil? if she wanted to push Bran it is not out of some ill intent towards him but because of self preservation for her and mote importantly her children, she knows that if Bran spreads her secret not only will she be killed, but all of heir children will be butchered by Robert Baratheon. Any mother in the same situation would have made the choice to save their own children if they had to. This does not make her evil. This is going to become a theme btw, Cersei does make gruesome decisions when forced into a corner with no way out. Though it can be argued that she isn't even responsible for this one.\n\n\\- Showing sympathy to Catlyn\n\nNumber two is a good deed. After Bran falls she shows sympathy to Catlyn and tells her about losing her first child. Small deed but this absolutely important for her character.\n\n\\- Killing Sansa's wolf (lady).\n\nThis undoubtedly looks like a cruel act, but if we try to remove our bias for cute puppies is it really?. First of all, she does it to correct the humility Joffrey suffered of being beaten by a girl and bitten by a wolf. Also, in the modern era we put down dogs who bite humans, which makes her action even more reasonable, and she doesn\u2019t know whether Arya and the Wolf ambushed Joffrey or if Joffrey started the fight (which he did), as she wasn\u2019t there. And she obviously believes her son before Arya. This reasonable justification is something I think differentiates her from the truly evil characters like Joffrey and Ramsay, they don\u2019t need a justification for their actions. They are cruel for the sake of being cruel. And other characters like Tywin who I also consider evil have extremely flimsy excuses for their evil deeds, (Tywin is unnecessary cruel to Tyrion for his mother dying in childbirth, something he has no responsibility for. Tywin is extremely intelligent and knows deep down that Tyrion doesn\u2019t have any responsibility which is why his continued cruelty is evil).\n\n\\- Having Robert killed.\n\nIf a friend you knew got physically abused, verbally abused, sexually abused, ignored and mocked for years would you think it was evil to kill the abuser? THE ANSWER IS NO, and that happened to Cersei. And furthermore, she once again only has Robert killed once she is forced into a corner where her children will be killed or hunted down for the rest of her life if she doesn\u2019t as Ned is about to tell him her secret. 100% justified.\n\n\\- Being partly responsible for having Ned starks men killed in the Throne room. \n\nThis is once again a fully justified action and it doesn\u2019t just lie on her shoulders, Littlefinger and Janos Slynt both have some responsibility. Ned Stark is threatening to strip her and her children of all power, imprison them and to leave them at the mercy of Stannis Baratheon who would probably have them killed as they threaten his legitimacy if they should return to Tywin. Cersei gives Ned ample opportunity to swear loyalty to Joffrey and return to Winterfell, unharmed with all his men and both his daughters. This is an extremely generous offer considering he has already said he knows her secret. He rejects this and forces her hand; Ned stark is fully to blame for getting his men killed.\n\n\\- Trying to get Ned Stark to join the nights watch\n\nThis is a good deed, she is trying to avoid war and giving ned the opportunity to stay at the watch instead of rotting in a cell for the rest of his life. Once again, extremely generous.\n\n\\- Cersei tries to stop Joffrey from having Ned stark killed\n\nCersei does try to get Joffrey to stop the execution of Ned stark. Some ridiculously argue that she didn\u2019t try hard enough. ZERO of the powerful people (Varys, Pycelle, etc) around Joffrey at the time manage to make him change his mind. This is a good deed as she is trying to avoid war once again.\n\n**Season 2**\n\nNow we have come to season 2. And in this season Cersei doesn\u2019t do a single act that is even questionable. And no, being rude to Tyrion once after he joked about her incest isn\u2019t evil. That\u2019s verbal payback for being mocked. The same goes for being angry at him for basically kidnapping Myrcella. And while she imprisons Rose (because she believes Tyrion cares about her), she only does this to make sure Tyrion doesn\u2019t hurt Joffrey, she immediately lets her go once Blackwater is finished and doesn\u2019t torture her. So lets move on to good deeds.\n\nGood deeds.\n\n\\- She gives Catlyn Ned starks bones back. Yes Tyrion suggests it, but she allows it (Which she has no reason to do if she is truly evil).\n\n\\- She gives Sansa advice and once again shows sympathy to her after her period. She recommends she has a child, so she gets some happiness in her life. Literally no other reason to suggest this other than being kind (and no she doesn\u2019t care about Lannister legacy like Tywin does). \n\n\\- She is clearly disturbed by Joffrey torturing prostitutes and being cruel to Sansa. Literally questioning whether Joffreys cruelness is a price for her incest. One of the most humane moments in the show.\n\n\\- She first lies to Sansa about Ser Ilynn being in Magors Holdfast to protect them as she doesn\u2019t want Sansa to be scared. Only when she gets more drunk does she admit the truth (which obviously isn\u2019t evil either).\n\n\\- She is about to kill Tommen when she thinks the battle is lost to spare him from the pain of Stannis killing her and him. \n\nSERIOUSLY TO DOUBTERS, LOOK AT ALL THESE GOOD DEEDS.\n\n**Season 3.**\n\nCersei being Jealous of Margery\n\n\\- Yes Cersei is Jealous of Margaery, but she doesn\u2019t say or do anything that is out of line before Margaery literally tries to manipulate her during Sansas wedding with the whole \u201clets be sisters\u201d, Cersei realizes this and turns hostile as anybody would if they know they are being knowingly manipulated.\n\nCersei recommends Tyrion give Sansa a Child\n\n\\- Once again, a really good deed. No, she is not doing it to impress Tywin, it is made explicitly clear that she doesn\u2019t care about his legacy in season 4. She does it because she wants Sansa to have some happiness in her life, an extremely good deed.\n\nCersei tries to stop Joffrey from verbally abusing Sansa at her wedding\n\n\\- Another good deed, she doesn\u2019t like the unnecessary cruelty of Joffrey and tried to stop him from doing it.\n\nCersei is disturbed by Joffreys insistence of serving Rob Starks head to Sansa. \n\n\\- Some would argue its just to attempt to control him, I totally disagree. If you watch the scence her smile evaporates once Joffrey shows his cruelty, and she looks disturbed and tries to talk him out of the idea.\n\n**Season 4**\n\nIn this Season Cersei is a bit more questionable but nothing that rises to level of \u201cevil\u201d.\n\nCersei wants Pycelle to feed the leftovers of Joffreys weddings to the dogs.\n\n\\- This is just done out of Jealously, while it is certainly childish it isn\u2019t evil.\n\nCersei wants to kill Tyrion\n\n\\- She truly believes he killed Joffrey, she is obviously wrong, but no parent is evil in my view for wanting their child\u2019s killer dead. \n\nCersei tells Tywin the truth about her incest.\n\n\\- This is a morally grey deed. Though I would say its mainly done out of love, she thinks he wants to steal and manipulate her son (which he basically does want).\n\n**Season 5** \n\nSeason 5 is more of the same.\n\nCersei imprisons Loras and is partly responsible for Margaerys imprisonment\n\n\\- Margery only has herself to blame, she mocks Cersei infront of an audience of girls. Insulting her drinking habbits, telling her about having sex with her son, rubbing in the fact that Cersei is no longer queen. And no this hostility isn\u2019t just Cersei\u2019s fault, Margaery started the hostility by attempting to manipulate her. And while it is once again childish of Cersei to imprison Loras, that\u2019s really all it is. She just wanted some short term schadenfreude. She had no idea how powerful the faith militant would become and did not intend to start a war with the Tyrells. She is clearly ignorant in this situation, not evil.\n\nCersei rubs it in Margaerys face that she is in prison\n\n\\- Margaery did the same to her, enough said.\n\n**Season 6**\n\nCersei kills a guy who flashes her in the lowest moment of her life. \n\n\\- This guy literally sexually harasses her, and then continues to brag about it. She is the victim not him. Not evil.\n\nCersei blows up the sept.\n\n\\- I am guessing this is moment some might believe, aha gotcha. But no. Cersei tries every other option before resorting to this extreme. She tries to simply stay in the red keep and put it all behind her, that\u2019s not enough for the faith as they demand she is put on trial, she tries to solve that by having a trial by combat, the high sparrow then manipulates Tommen into absolving Trial by combat and sends Jaime away so he wont be there to protect her.\n\n\\- When she has no other way out, her life is on the line. The city is ruled by religious fanatics who brutalize anybody who dissent she finally blows up the sept. She even saves her son who betrayed her. Also, if not for the faith militants stupidity Margaery and Loras might even have survived and another war could have been avoided. The absolute majority of the blame here is on the faith militant and the high sparrow who gave her no choice.\n\nCersei kills Pycelle\n\n\\- Pycelle is a disgusting man responsible for allowing Tywin Lannister to sack kings landing, he likes very young girls (though I am not saying he is interested in children), he manipulates Tommen and he stares at Cersei with a sexual smirk after she does her walk of atonement. Though killing him is cruel he is clearly a man who would betray her the first chance he got and also not a decent person. This act is cruel, I admit that. But one cruel act does not make one evil, especially considering the MANY good deeds she does.\n\n**Season 7**\n\nShe mainly just rules as a monarch trying to defend her kingdom, defending yourself against an illegitimate and whiny invader like Daenerys is not evil in the slightest. Yes, she does kill the Sand snake (don\u2019t remember her name) and the wife of Oberyn in a rather cruel way, however they literally killed her daughter just to start a war. Totally justified from Cersei. \n\nCersei allows Olenna Tyrell a peacefull and painless death\n\n\\- Some of you might argue that since she even considered a cruel death for her enemy, she is evil. Absolutely not, it is precisely the fact that she is able to reconsider which makes her different from evil people like Joffrey who don\u2019t. \n\nCersei allows Jaime Lannister to leave her unharmed, even though he is betraying her by fighting with her enemies.\n\n\\- Once again, an extremely generous act considering what he is doing. Betraying her to fight for another house. And no it was absolutely justified by Cersei to not honour her pledge to fight against the white walkers. Daenerys (the spoiled brat) literally says she will invade her afterwards despite the help.\n\n**Season 8**\n\nSeason 8 doesn\u2019t count, and she spends her time staring out of windows and complaining about elephants. Season 8 sucks\n\nIn conclusion, while Cersei is certainly not good, and is perhaps one of the most flawed characters on the show she is still FAR from evil. She doesn\u2019t enjoy cruelty to people who haven\u2019t harmed her severely (like killing her child), she can often give good advice and show sympathy, she often tries to stop her son from being cruel, etc.","1005":"[removed]","1006":"I KNOW this is unpopular, especially these days where so many young people think it is OK to live at home indefinitely.

It is often said that Russia would have never industrialized as \"well\" as the Soviets did, they wouldnt have the \"freedom\" and the better life that the Soviets had! But it couldnt be further from the truth - Russian empire was geopolitcally and economically the China  of the early 20th century\n\nAs most revoliutions, they only change things in which the society was already heading. Soviet union didnt begin the industrialization - they only accelarated it. Russian empire built from 1864 to 1918 about 70 000 killometres! For a comparison, Soviets in a longer time built 51 000 km of railroads\n\nRussian Empire was already one of the strongest countries in the world, before the soviets. One of the reasons for ww1 was a fear of the Russian horde by the germans. if i remember correctly, germans predicted(prob incorectly) that by 1916 Russia would have a bigger than german economy and strength.\n\nSoviet union butchered and forced to obey its stupid rules to the russian people and espiacially \"inteligencia\".

But im gonna give credit to where its done - they made the country more literate and other advances in schooling. Not like the russian empire were having fastly increasing literacy before the soviets :)(in 1897 it had roughly 28% and in 1916 it had 56%)\n\nRussian industrialisation was very messy. Anything that is forced is usually not healthy for a society as whole - Forced industrialisation, Forced Urbanisation(lowered the birthrate by a lot, but increased the GDP and quality of life, hell yeah!), forced  collectivisation, which was a ridicoulusly stupid. Colletivisation was a huge failure. It provoked So much resistance by peasants and kulaks that they burnt their own crops so commies wouldnt get it and the most succesful of farmers that didnt surrendered were shot or deported. Also another thing i want to add to soviet industrialisation is that they focused way too much on Heavy industry. Light industry sucked badly. Like really really badly.

Males and females generally are sexualized differently, and have generally different physiology. But that being said, it feels like everyone in control of media have something against EVER showing us ANY exceptions to the rule. Movies, shows, comics, video games alike.  \n\n\nSo, you might ask - what do I mean with sexualizing males the same way females are visually? Well, it's many aspects that together form consistent double standards in sexualization. When was the last time you saw a sexy male character wear an impractical outfit meant to make them look sexy and not to be empowering or practical, and they make sexually suggestive poses not meant to be for fighting but to be titillating, and they show off their ass and legs with the camera angle or panel focusing on it, and they might even have skin-revealing clothes to show it off better, and they have a nice round ass at that?  \n\n\nAnd please don't lecture me about how men and women are different - I get it, I've heard those arguments millions of times. But again, even IF that is the case, there are no exceptions to the rules. Outside of porn, you don't really get to see let's say a sexy femboy, twink, or even a more traditionally masculine man appear in this fashion.  \n\n\nIt's not that people don't want to see it either. Not only have I talked to tons and tons of people who wouldn't mind seeing it, but all the porn I've seen of it speaks in volumes too.  \n\n\nIs it a big deal? Technically not. But for some reason, my brain obsesses over it. I struggle a lot with anxiety and depression, and my brain won't let go of things. Ever since I became aware of this double standard being a thing, I feel like I can see it everywhere. They overly emphasize female butts SOOO much more in every way possible than male butts.  \n\n\nYes, I know it's a weird obsession. But I can't help it. I wish I could. I wish I could just relax and stop thinking about it and focus on more important things. But, well, that's not how depression works, I'm afraid.","1015":"[removed]","1016":"This opinion is unpopular worldwide, especially in the international community. I think that the supposed \u201cright\u201d to \u201cNational Self Determination\u201d is stupid. I hate anyone who supports it. For those who don\u2019t known, this means that an ethnic group is entitled to its own nation. I think that this concept has enabled nationalism and this concept has devastated multicultural societies.\n\nThe entire world order is based around this idea, it\u2019s even one of the stated core principles of the United Nations. This is the cause of so much civil war ethnic violence, Especially in Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East. When people think that their ethnic group is entitled to its own nation and they don\u2019t get their way then it drives people to start rebellions and civil wars which tear apart their multiethnic societies.\n\nJust think of all the recent ethnic violence between ethnic groups in Yugoslavia, Sudan, Iraq, Cyprus, etc. where idiots thought that their ethnic group deserves its own nation? Honestly what good has this \u201cself-determination\u201d and all the little ethno-states that have come out of it caused? There hasn\u2019t been that much ethnic violence throughout history. No one has ever really given a damn about ethnicity and multiple ethnic groups have (usually) lived together in the same state. Multicultural\/Multiethnic societies are the norm throughout history, especially in the Middle East.\n\nA lot of contemporary political analysts for example say that Iraq for example is unstable because it has Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, and Kurdish people living in the same nation and there is so much sectarian (ethnic) violence between these three ethnic groups. Yet what the political analysts forget is that all throughout Middle Eastern history, there have been large multicultural societies where different ethnic groups have lived (usually) together just fine. \n\nLiberals (in an international sense, not a US politics sense) push the idea of \u201cNational Self Determination\u201d and then wonder why there is so much Nationalism. Liberals push an idea that promotes ethnic states and then wonder why there is so much Nationalism based around those ethnic states.\n\nEthnic separatists are enabled by liberals who romanticize the idea of \u201csupposedly oppressed ethnic minority fights for freedom against evil majority ethnic group.\u201d Ethnic separatists are NOT a good thing. I despise them. They tore apart Yugoslavia and many other impressive multiethnic societies.\n\nI would also argue that the root cause of oppression and racism in the world is that the reactionary Nationalists from the dominant ethnic group are reacting to the ethnic separatists of the minority ethnic groups. If it wasn\u2019t for the idea of \u201cNational Self Determination\u201d there wouldn\u2019t be so much ethnic violence in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop being two-faced and oppose ALL Nationalism, no matter who it\u2019s coming from. We need to realize that National Self-Determination and Multiculturalism are mutually exclusive and that NO ethnic group is entitled to its own nation and oppose anyone who believes in ethno-states.","1017":"For the record, I would be in favor of paying more in taxes if it meant homeless people had a warm, safe roof over their heads.

Some might say that it's cruel, but what I think is really cruel is talking a big game about things like compassion and human dignity only to do fuck all when it comes to solving actual humanitarian problems. Ergo, the jail solution. It's not what I would prefer, but a non-ideal solution is still a solution.","1018":"There, I said it. And yes, I strongly agree with it. And this officer is a strong example of why. Here's the breakdown of it.\n\nMohammed Noor is a former Minneapolis, Minnesota cop who killed Justine Damond, a young yoga instructor. So here's the story. On the night of the shooting July 15, 2017, Damond called 911 to report a woman she thought was being raped. This resulted in two officers, one of them being Noor to be dispatched to the scene. But there was no evidence of such after the investigation. But then, Damond approached the squad car they were in and Noor fired his gun at her killing her in the process claiming that he feared for his life. This killing led to global outrage and he was eventually charged and sentenced, initially for 12 1\/2 years but was now reduced to 57 months. That's the summary of what happened that night. But here's where things take an interesting, ironic, and hypocritical turn.\n\nWe've seen a lot of incidents regarding police brutality\/shooting here in America where for the most part, the victims are ordinary Black citizens and the suspects are White cops. Such cases have pitted people in two groups, obviously Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter. When the trial for the cops are set, they are usually found not guilty of all wrongdoing. According to Black Lives Matter, they think the killing was unjustified for whatever reason. For Blue Lives Matter, they think the victim should've complied and that the cop was doing his\/her job.\n\nNow let's cut to the chase. This particular police shooting is significant as the cop is a Black Somali Muslim immigrant and the victim was a White Australian immigrant. Do you think Blue Lives Matter will support the former? The answer.......was surprisingly, NO. Instead, they supported the innocent victim. And as a result, the narrative was flipped upside down and a new one emerged. Many people, particularly on the Right (which Blue Lives Matter is usually supported by) have grown critical of the officer who they believed was fast tracked due to affirmative action. They even brought up past allegations of misconduct made by him. This abrupt change in tone has caused many people, most notably social justice activists\/Black Lives Matter to question how certain victims of police are usually portrayed by the media with White victims being labeled innocent and Black victims being labeled as villains. They even predicted that if the officer was convicted, it wouldn't be surprising at all. And yes, if you're wondering Black Lives Matter along with other groups marched in support for Justine Damond.\n\nSo here's my conclusion, the fact that Blue Lives Matter isn't coming to the support of the officer in this particular case goes to show that it's a sham organization cause obviously, not all Blue Lives matter with this guy being one of them. They always say the same thing about Black Lives Matter but not in the case with their own group. It also debunks their belief that All Lives Matter as well as the Conservative message that they don't see color and see everyone as equal because obviously this wasn't the case here due to their accusations of affirmative action against him. In fact, in my opinion when I hear them say that they don't see color, they obviously mean they only see White as White isn't a color.\n\n\\*To close off, I support Justine Damond and I continue to support every act of justice for her and her family as they continue to grieve her tragic and unjustified loss.","1019":"Let's swap roles, suppose the USSR \"won\" the Cold War.

Think about it...\n\nThe Cold War would continue, in actuality, there is a Cold War right now.","1020":"I would like everyone to know that I am even more opposed to religion than I am evolution.  FWIW - just trying to avoided the assumption that I'm Christian.\n\n- There are at least two pictures floating around online of Charles Darwin signaling that he is a member of a secret society that is known for their belief that Lucifer is God.\n- The purpose of \"The Origin of Species\" was to guide society towards a mass atheist movement.\n- When the \"Theory of Evolution\" was first introduced, two of the main points were that life started from a primordial soup and that man was descended from monkey.  These two ideas were then intentionally used as evidence that God must not exist.\n- The \"primordial soup\" premise was dropped from the theory of evolution and made into a separate branch of science called abiogenesis - which has made zero progress and essentially dead ended at takeoff.  The idea that we evolved from monkeys has also become essentially obsolete.\n- The news that dinosaur fossils had been found across the globe was also used as a way to induce a mass atheist movement.  Dinosaurs can be placed in the same category as gods when it comes to actual proof and evidence that they exist.  Sorry paleontologists, you're the Mormons of science.\n- The theory of evolution has spent over a century continuously moving the goalposts.  It's like trying to forcefully shove a square hole through a round peg.  They have spent so much time and effort trying to make the idea of evolution real.  A great example of the scientific method in use!\n- Evolution has been widdled down to nothing more than the fact that things adapt to their environment over time.  Wow, mind is blown.\n- Changes in allele frequency do not suggest progress being made, but rather a back and forth reaction to environmental factors causing small changes, and then many years later changes to changes.  There is nothing there to create advancement into complexity.  Adaptation does not require the advancement into complexity, not does it provide anything to be directed towards this.  Evolution is a process akin to \"getting something for nothing\".\n- The guided, intelligent evolution of the wolf failed to introduce complexity  not an advancement in intellect.  How was nature able to do this by sheer coincidence?\n- Upon discovering DNA it was declared that \"it appears to be a set of instructions\".  Instructions denote intelligence.  DNA has also been compared to \"a living language\" and \"biological programming\".  \n- There is no evidence for common ancestry, only misinterpretations of the fossil record.  The tree of life and common ancestry are not real.  Similarities in DNA between species no more suggests common ancestry than it does intelligent design - these are both interpretations that require faith to believe in.\n-  There is no evolutionary advantage to a female G-spot orgasm, or any female orgasm. There is no evolutionary advantage to a prostate orgasms.\n- There is no evolutionary advantage to being born so incredibly premature.  Our oversized brains evolving naturally as an evolutionary advantage would require foresight and intelligence.. of course, it could've just been the result of a random mutation.\n- There is zero evolutionary advantage to the experience of empathy.  None.  Try to force an explanation anyway you would like, but nature only moves in a narcissistic direction.  There is no way that empathy could have developed in the way you people believe.\n- What could be the evolutionary advantage for human beings to destroy their natural habitat?  Are we a highly complex and intelligent parasite?  There is no evolutionary mechanism available to explain human creativity.  \n- There is zero proof that linear time is actually real.  Evolution requires that linear time is real. Nothing can evolve in the eternal moment.  Ok, I shouldn't have done this one.  Oh well.\n- Vestigial organs are a misinterpretation.  There is zero proof that there are vestigial organs or features.\n- In unrelated news quantum physics has proven that matter requires an observer in order to exist.\n\nWell, goodnight everyone.","1021":"Gene editing technology has the potential to save and improve the lives of untold millions of people by eliminating genetic disorders. \n\nMoreover gene editing could potentially be used in crop production to create better crop yields and improve nutrition.  There is also the potential to create lab grown meat which could replace the animal agriculture industry.\n\nI am in favor of researching this technology at all costs. I don't care if we need to pay poor people to get experimented on. I don't care if scientists use orphans as unwilling test subjects. I don't care if people make test tube babies specifically for the purposes of editing their genes.\n\nEven if thousands of people get their genes severely fucked up it will be worth it if we can perfect the technology and help millions of people.","1022":"Both groups follow regressive, controlling religions, which are Christianity and Islam. Both groups seek to restrict the rights of the people who live under them. For example: Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan. Both groups seek hate anything that they deem progressive. They both go hand in hand, and are closer than people think.","1023":"Remember the clich\u00e9-ridden arguments from the Right that they make about the Left about identity politics and victimhood? Some of popular arguments are that they patronize minorities by making them think one way and brainwash them on so-called victim mentality and oppression, as well as judging people by the color of their skin instead of their character. I personally agree with them that victimhood and thinking one way shouldn't be required and that character does matter. But at the same time, I think the Right should practice what they preach and implement those arguments to themselves because to this day, they're not doing that. And what I mean by that is that they too have their own form of identity politics and victimhood.\n\nSome examples of such are centered over the demographics and values of their base. Obviously, the party is around 85-90% White, Christian, Straight, and Evangelical. And then when such changes are happening in society, particularly a desire to become more inclusive and progressive in society, they feel constantly victimized. We got people like Tomi Lahren complaining about Wars on Straight White Males, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter, and Nick Fuentes complaining about demographics, Evangelical and GOP leaders complaining about an LGBTQ, Muslim agenda being implemented, as well as the War on Christmas bullshit, etc. The recent controversy over the national GOP accepting members of the LGBTQ community (Log Cabin Republicans) has caused many state GOP leaders to condemn it. And speaking of my last comment about content of character that Conservatives love to preach, whenever Right-Wing media outlets like Fox News and Breitbart report crime stories done by minorities, in particular Black people, the comments are usually filled with racist comments like the N-Word, 13%, and other outrageous stereotypes. Go onto the GOP's recent page when they posted Black History Month, so much White Grievance in the comments. The same can be said about the GOP's recent page wishing Muslims a Happy Ramadan. Nothing but Christian persecution mentality and Evangelical hokum. Furthermore, they always say that Blacks have a plantation mentality and are incapable to think for themselves because of the Left.\n\nHearing and reading this, I really wonder if these guys ever listen to what they're saying? In fact, are these the same guys that love to preach against so-called Leftist identity politics and victimhood? Because it obviously seems like the opposite is in play here and they fail to see the irony of such. In fact, with their constant ranting and raving over such culture issues and engaging in such semantics, they're engaging in their own form of identity politics. One that is much more worse and hypocritical than the Left's. And as they continue to ostracize these communities, they continue to profess confusion as to why they think one way. Here's my answer to their troublesome ignorance: They think one way for a very important reason and it definitely wasn't on-purpose. It's because you constantly berate them to the point that they start to radicalize and as a result, they think collectively and start embracing their identities more. Once you pull the trigger on them, they'll fight back. In other words, turn around, fair play. And as a result, they'll start using classic slurs like Uncle Tom, Coconut, etc. and start bashing Straight, White Males and Evangelicals. Hence, you are personally responsible for what happens when you engage in the culture war.\n\nThis is why I laugh and find it cringeworthy that the Right preaches against identity politics. It exists because of them. It's their creation. This is why your party is predominantly White and it's ironic that you preach against such a notion when you don't look at the makeup of your own party. They created this and they should own this. After all, you are the party of responsibility, you should own this. If they really don't want identity politics to exist, they should actually see them as equals and not inferiors. And that will happen if they denounce all the attacks their fellow members on the Right make about them. That includes denouncing all the Republicans who pulled the birther movement on Obama among all the other racist and bigoted comments against him and his family. To me, that is going to be an uphill battle because if they do that, they will be considered as woke, panderers, and virtue-signaling. Even worse, they'll be called Cucks, which I addressed in a recent post on this sub as the White Conservative version of an Uncle Tom. In my opinion, a huge double standard. Not only that, they shouldn't sheepishly hide behind the First Amendment as a shield when such incidents happen because it will lead some people to believe that they indirectly support it. If you have a problem with those terms being used, too bad. Remember, we're not supposed to be politically correct. Ever since the election of President Trump, political correctness has been placed in the trash. But what you failed to realize is that it goes both ways.\n\nHow would you like it if I say that White Evangelical Conservatives have a victimhood mentality and a persecution fetish and they are slaves to the Republican plantation with no ability to think for themselves. See where I'm going? Funny how that works. These guys love to play victim of discrimination yet they are extremely overrepresented in that party. I for one would like people to be judged as individuals, but if one party constantly preaches that yet goes against it every time like what the GOP does, they need to do a little soul-searching and rebranding. That's my honest opinion on such a controversial issue like this. What do you think?\n\n\\*Sorry for the rather long rant. But I think it needs to be said. I also decided to reorganize this into paragraphs so this way, it will be more clear for you guys to understand.","1024":"[removed]","1025":"[removed]","1026":"[removed]","1027":"[removed]","1028":"That\u2019s right, 7.

But what would you do if someone keeps denying the severity of it getting to the point where they don't adhere to any safety precautions such as wearing masks that they end up getting affected by the virus and die? Would you mourn them, consider it karma, or both? I'd do both and what better way to express it than with the Herman Cain Award. This popular Reddit site is obviously named after former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain who was diagnosed with COVID after attending an Oklahoma Trump rally maskless. Prior to his diagnosis and death, he expressed skepticism as well as mocked the severity of COVID and after his death, this sub was made and it continues the tradition of tracking down anyone who constantly brag and deny the severity of COVID as well as all the health regulations required to combat it. It even includes ghoulish memes ranging from racist, sexist, bigoted posted on their social media wall.

And it just doesn't help that the majority of deaths are from Conservatives since they are constantly being fed misleading propaganda about the virus.

Used mostly by minorities, particularly the Black community when they see people of their kind who think differently and in the end vote Republican instead of Democrat? You know, like a \"self-hating person\". And when that term is used, Conservatives particularly White Conservatives get offended and up in arms criticizing them for being racist for supposedly stating that they should be thinking one way. But what they fail to realize is that they use very similar terminology to describe Whites who vote Democrat or are Conservatives who have moderate views on certain social issues like race, religion, gender, sexuality, and of course immigration. Such examples of terminology are \"cuck\", \"beta male\", \"soy boy\", and \"girly boy\". The first term is the most common among the four. Some people have stated that these are alt-right terms and that they are not common among Conservatives, but if you check out Conservative outlets like Breitbart, Fox News, etc., the users use those terms a lot to describe any White who they see as self-hating, having so-called \"White Guilt\", and voting Democrat, as well as any Conservative pushing a diversity agenda or so-called \"pandering\" as they see it. Seems like they have made themselves mainstream by the sound of things. Reading these comments, I can't help but wonder the hilarious and hypocritical irony behind this. As they use these terms, I wonder if these are the same people who take issue when minorities use the term \"Uncle Tom\" for the pretty much the exact same reasons they use those words for. If so, they need some self-reflection. Furthermore, the fact that they get offended by terms such as \"Uncle Tom\" and other similar terminology like \"coon\", \"Oreo\", \"coconut\" goes against their beliefs that the Left are snowflakes who want to be politically correct.

But this argument doesn't make any sense to me if one presupposes that conscious experience is something that can only be formed in a living brain and that any conscious awareness that may exist in a ZEF would be of the most rudimentary variety.\n\nThink about it. If your mother had chosen to abort you, then you would not have even known about it, and would never have had the opportunity to desire anything that life could offer you. You would also have been spared any suffering that would inevitably arise as part and parcel of being a conscious entity. So abortion prevents all the bad, without really imposing the loss of the good (because the 'good' was never desired to begin with, and a corpse can no more desire the goods of life than any other clump of inanimate matter).\n\nAs you'll have probably guessed, my mother chose not to have an abortion. As a consequence of that decision, I am now a slave to basic biological needs that were imposed on me without my consent, and I need to work 5 days a week at a demoralising and stressful job that I detest just in order to meet those needs (and hope that there is no serious adversity that hits me out of the blue) and truthfully, spend much of the other 2 days dreading the long 5 day gauntlet that awaits me ahead. And society broadly tells me that I'm insane if I'd want to end this drudgery in favour of a return to the harmlessness of non-existence, and then claims that because I'd have to be certifiably insane not to want to endure another several decades of this, they need to act in my best interests by preventing me from accessing some lethal drug or gas that would end my suffering instantly and without pain. If I'd have been aborted, my mind wouldn't be floating around in some limbo, lamenting and resenting the fact that I wasn't given the opportunity to be a cog in the capitalist machinery.\n\nEven if you believe that abortion is a serious harm because death is a harm, it is still by far the lesser harm, considering that once a living organism exists, death is inevitable. So you do not prevent death by preventing abortion. You merely postpone it, and force that organism to go through what could potentially be a severe imbalance between pain and pleasure before dying, and ensure that death itself will probably be drawn out and painful, and the person will be terrified of their own mortality whilst approaching death.\n\nAll in all, there's just not a lot to be said ethically in favour of the choice to carry a pregnancy to term, by any metric except for ones that take into consideration the future of the economy (and demographic imbalances that might result). That's why I am not pro-choice.","1061":"Recently, I read an article talking about how Miranda's characteristics and personality make her an an ableist character. I read it through, now I'd like to give my point by point reasons as to why she *isn't*. \n\nThe character of Miranda Sings, was originally based off the \"cocky teenage female singers\" on YouTube, but has afterwards, flourished into who she is today. \n\nThe Miranda we know now is cocky, selfish, a know-it-all, sheltered and spoiled. Basing those around her in off of Haters Back Off, she has an absentee father, a mother with critical attention seeking isses & munchausen syndrome, a sister that doesn't want to be associated with her what-so-ever, an immature uncle who validates her behavior for online views and a love interest that ignores her behavior, because he's obsessed with her. \n\nMiranda is homeschooled..by who? No one, apparently. She has 4 horrible examples of people in her life, without learning anything factual. So when the only two \"positive\" influences in her live validate her every thought and move, she's going to:\n\n\n1. Not have the complex vocabulary that other 17 year olds have\n\n\n2. When corrected with grammar or information (as youtubers have done hundreds of times) she will deny any wrong doing and insist that she's right, youtubers give up and in doing so, it only solidifies her belief in that she could never be wrong. \"Pentatonix\" and \"Graceffa\" were tongue twisters for her, much like people who are unable to say \"Abominable\" or \"Aluminum\" \n\n\n3. Think that she's a professional at everything she tries and \"succeeds\" at once, in her mind. (she mentioned in the sing along challenge with Hannah Hart that if you aren't good at something the first time, stop trying), So she'll list off \"who she is\" - singer, actor, model & magician.\n\n\n4. Bouncing off of that, she's horrible at all of these professions, which is the whole point of her videos. Making fun of people who are arrogant and believe they are the best at what they do, refusing to take any pointers, refusing to be corrected and getting upset when argued with. \n\n\n5. She's not necessarily \"slut shaming\" just to shame people. Miranda is a hardcore Christian, which is mentioned in several earlier videos. This was to make a joke out of religion itself. She insists on not making things porn, that drinking alcohol is a sin, lying is a sin and so on, but has blatantly contradicted herself in multiple videos, after being caught by the very people she shamed for doing these things. \n\n6. Uncle Jim was never a pervert towards Miranda. The whole point in Uncle Jim's story was heavily misconstrued, because Miranda accidentally made him out to be one, throughout the time she mentioned him and the people around her assumed he was her real uncle. Originally, Uncle Jim turned out to be Miranda's mom's orange tabby cat. (Hence loving to cuddle, being Miranda's \"first kiss\", knocking over Miranda's chia pet, Miranda suggesting he'd like a random piece of clothing that she'd get and not want for Christmas etc.) \n\n\n7. Miranda is weird and rude around others because she's sheltered and hadn't had a lot of socialization in the first 17 years of her life. \n\n\nColleen had mentioned before that her and her brother Chris had sat down and made out a very detailed character with a full story of who she was and was surrounded with. Miranda Sings was never an ableist character and it's really quite disappointing when someone who clearly didn't do their research, assumed that she is. In short: she's is an uneducated, isolated, know-it-all with a god complex. That's all.","1062":"I always hear that capitalism incentivizes efficiency but that has been the opposite of my experience in the workforce.

It's worked a couple hundred years or so but eventually... Things evolve and so as we enter the age of enlightment through science and technology, religion, in all its forms becomes a roadblock. \n\nNowadays younger people break free from the indoctrination at younger and younger ages.

It might be difficult for love to form under these circumstances, but if it forms, i don't see reasons to oppose it. \nIf it personally makes you sick, maybe this is a you problem ? A lot of people find disgusting to be gay, to eat meat, to eat eyes,  to call your partner daddy, but those things are allowed, and moral. If you don't like it, it doesn't make it bad.\nI can't think of any other arguments against it, nor can any people I spoke to about this, so it should be moral, right ? \nA lot of people will argue that whether you can find arguments for something to be moral doesn't make it moral, moral is subjective, and that's true, to a degree.

Ron always managed to stay on the border with all the sulking and arguing.\n\nThose who point to the similarities between Hermione and Harry seem to be trying to pair up brother and sister rather than two lovers.  Lovers are not about sameness.  They are about complimenting each other's differences as well preventing boredom with eachother.  Ron and Hermione together were a fountain of drama.   Harry and Hermione together were calmer and more forgiving.   They were of similar character being hardworking, serious, focused on the future, and altruistic.\n\nNext, Hermione was NOT a naturally rebellious person.  Her natural instinct is to be a complete goody-two-shoes.  Out of pure intelligence dictating the necessity of it, she often rebelled.   But she was going against her own character.\n\nAnd those females of the goody-two-shoes character type tend to go for the willful bad boy.   We can see this clearly with her choice of Crookshanks as a pet, the absolute most annoying cat in the world that nobody else wanted.   We also see it in her love interest Victor Krum.   Who was more of a willful bad boy, Harry or Ron?   Clearly it was Ron.\n\nAND Herminone always was the helpful type.  Look how she kept trying to help house elves who didn't want it.  Look how she was always helping Hagrid despite it seeming to be a complete waste of time and energy to everyone else.  She was so often helping Ron and Harry to do anything at school.  And who needed help more and more often?   Harry or Ron?   Clearly it was Ron again.\n\nHowever you feel about Ron, he had character.  He was very real.  He was often selfish, and even cowardly.   He was generally focused on right now, and had some good observation skills for it. He could be really stupid sometimes, but he wasn't just plain stupid.  He had talent in chess and on the Quiddich pitch, but he had anxiety issues. He was flawed.   But he had talent that he unleased with a little help from his friends...and he made Hermione KNOW shew as needed,  even when Ron was rejecting her....cause Hermione really was that smart to see the truth.\n\nLast, never underestimate the bond of shared trauma, and they went through a lot.  And that's why it was either Harry or Ron, and not some random Victor Krum again.\n\nFact is, JK Rowling may herself disagree with her own decision in this.  But JK Rowling is such a genius deep down that maybe she cannot even understand her own genius analyzing it from the surface.    I believe she made her choice from what her gut told her.   And her gut made that choice from what we see all the time.  We ALWAYS see couples that don't immediately make sense to us, so Ron and Herminone not making immediate sense to us MAKES SENSE on that level alone.   But the subconcious often realizes deep things we don't see at a glance, and I have already illustrated what those are.   JK Rowling may just now not be able to consciously see what her subconscious mind saw clearly 25 years ago.","1074":"And same applies to men of course. why would I date someone. yes.

For one, men tend to have far more aggressive and confrontational personalities than women. While men are more predisposed to using verbal or physical aggression, women are more likely to utilise [relational aggression](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Relational_aggression), which is far more indirect and crucially does not involve any kind of criminal act.\n\nAnother factor here is that men on average are more willing to make reckless life choices for the prospect of a reward and are harder to deter with the threat of negative consequences. Women are known to be [more risk averse when it comes to things like finance](https:\/\/www.city.ac.uk\/news-and-events\/news\/2019\/10\/women-dislike-financial-risk-taking-research-finds) for example, so it's not hard to see why the prospect of jail time would have a greater effect on their behaviour.\n\nYet another cause of the disparity might even be anger management. While men and women both feel anger to the same degree, [women are actually better at anger management than men](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Technology\/story?id=97882&page=1), possibly due to differences in brain structure. Since anger is the emotion that often drives violent and aggressive behaviour, it makes sense that men finding it harder to control would commit more crimes like assault and battery.","1079":"First of all I will say that there are some people who can take anything too far.  Karl Popper once famously said that in order to maintain tolerance, we must be intolerant of the intolerant which he called the Paradox of Intolerance.  By going to far I mean those who want to use the freedoms we have in the West to subvert freedom itself.\n\nAlso let's make it perfectly clear: there is a differnce between someone who fights for real change in society and authentic social justice (for example, waiters getting paid a living wage) and the alt-right charicature of a SJW.  The first exists in real life, the second is an invention of the alt-right to smear progressive Americans who think different than them.\n\nAnyone who makes a big deal about hating SJW's over anything else spends too much time being annoyed on the Internet. Most of these folks don't run into anybody that actually challenges their viewpoint. Many right wing people throw about the term SJW like it's the ultimate insult, as if the person in question should feel small about it but why should they? This term seems to be used to describe basically just about anyone that speaks up on behalf of the rights of others, particularly if that group is being persecuted. So, actually, good for anyone that does that. Caring about your fellow humans believe it or not is actually a 'good quality' and standing up for them is good too. Personally I've been called a right-winger by leftist tankies and an SJW by alt-right chuds so I actually find both funny.  When I get called either I just say thanks very much.\n\nOver the years, I've come to realize that Anti-Sjws are some of the most delusional, half-witted, ironic, and whiny group of people there are. I see more Anti-Sjws complain about SJWS than I actually ever see SJWS. And say what you will about SJWs, but at least their values are morally righteous. They actually want to make a positive change.  Anti-SJWs actually want to make the world a worse place.","1080":"It's simple.

But why circumcise only males? In a volume entitled Questions and Answers on Genesis, Philo\u2019s answer is that\n\n>\u2018\u2018the male has more pleasure in, and desire for, mating than does the female, and he is more ready for it. Therefore Herightly leaves out the female, and **suppresses the undue impulses of the male by the sign of circumcision.

It has been thought that circumcision perfects what is defective congenitally. This gave the possibility to everyone to raise an objection and to say: How can natural things be defective so that they need to be perfected from outside, all the more because we know how useful the foreskin is for that member? **In fact this commandment has not been prescribed with a view to perfecting what is defective congenitally, but to perfecting what is defective morally. The bodily pain caused to that member is the real purpose of circumcision.** None of the activities necessary for the preservation of the individual is harmed thereby, nor is procreation rendered impossible, but violent concupiscence and lust that goes beyond what is needed are diminished. **The fact that circumcision weakens the faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes the pleasure is indubitable. For if at birth this member has been made to bleed and has had its covering taken away from it, it must indubitably be weakened. The Sages, may their memory be blessed, have explicitly stated: It is hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him.

The easiest examples to point to are any industry that commands a natural monopoly, in which the cost of entry is so high competition is nonexistent. Water, electricity, internet, social media, and infrastructure in general are all monopolies that are near impossible to break. Neoliberals realized this quite early and created their philosophy. They believe free markets require a strong state to maintain and the spread of neoliberalism has been nearly unstoppable ever since.\n\nNot to mention they can be extremely comedic in their attempts to create right wing libertarian societies.

The accusation is constantly thrown around that proponents of CRT try to silence their critics by calling them racists.  However I only see the opposite happening.  Multiple states are passing laws outlawing the teaching of any material related to CRT based on the accusation that it is \u201canti white racism\u201d.  However that accusation is not fact but opinion.  Certainly it is the opinion of the Harvard School of Law where CRT was developed that it is not anti white racism but rather a critical analysis of the ways systemic racism is perpetuated and interacts with the law.  If the anti-CRT side feels so confident that their views concerning systemic racism are correct than why are they making opposing viewpoints illegal?  That makes it look like they know they are wrong and are threatened by the truth.  The whole point of education is to be exposed to diverse perspectives and form your own opinion using critical analysis.

That's just my opinion, consistent with my functional usage needs. \n\nThe type of phone doesn't matter as much as the elements of it that I use and need such as the headphone jack and the fact that it is customizable, but I'll say it anyway. It's a Moto Stylus 5G 2021. For example, it does not have ads in native apps such as the music app like Samsung started doing. \n\nThis phone did not even come with a native Gallery app so I was able to choose whatever app I decided. Some people would say that is left of a feature and more of a nuisance, but I disagree. I am all about user customization and more particularly, user freedom.\n\nI feel it's unfair to compare my previous Samsung with this phone's features much further in this post as the earlier Samsung was supposedly factory unlocked but it was still Samsung which means the firmware and stock apps were had Samsung's wet blanket of control over them, while this new phone is a carrier phone. So, apples to oranges in those areas which I'll avoid when possible.\n\nFor me, ditching Samsung for the less \"popular\" brand Motorola has been the right decision due to my disagreement with Samsung's decisions.\nThese decisions are:\n\n- To be a follower (of Apple who removed their 3.5mm first) instead of a leader in the industry.\n\n- Dictating heavy-handed decisions regarding users' needs and requests en masse (Ok Google, remember dark\/black theme user requests in Android for YEARS?)\n\n- Ethical questions regarding ads in stock aps (particularly the music app) - or, more\n specifically, any kind of subscription-based business model that is unnecessary and therefore greedy.\n\nIt seems all these decisions are faced companies which gain any type of industry domination (Looking at you, gaming companies) companies fail to recognize the ones who made them great in the first place - their customers.\n\nI came across an article saying Samsung is going to stop putting ads in their stock apps. Great, but for me, it is too little too late as I have already moved on to a better company's product for good. Just because a big name is hugely popular does not mean the company makes the right decision for all users.\n\nAlso, I never noticed a premium \"flagship\" phone \"feature\" that didn't seem like a gimmick or unnecessary waste of money or time that actually enhanced the official day to day use of my phone. Curved screen and wireless charging to me, were more of a hassle or liability than they were worth.\n\nGoodbye, Samsung.","1200":"I'm honestly completely fine with cows being murdered.

But think about it, who commits rape? Mostly psychopathic people, who happen to be men. And what's a common factor among psychopaths? They don't care about what society says or believes in. Essentially saying \"don't rape\" is the same as saying \"don't murder\"; none of them will stop rape and murder respectively. Why? Precisely because rapists and murderers are immoral people who do NOT care about morality, law and humanity.\n\nTherefore, my solution is simple. Legalise STATE CONTROLLED prostitution. No, not that cliche prostitution, but a kind of prostitution wherein women (and\/or men) work by their own wish, and are supported by the nation. These sex workers would regularly undergo HIV\/AIDS testing, the way pornstars do.

How do you survive? You must gather resources by foraging or trading with other humans to get your food, water and shelter from the elements. Nature does not just give them to you, effort must be spent to obtain them. \n\nExpand this into the modern day. Most land\/resources are owned by others, so in order to obtain the necessary resources to survive one must trade with others. What resource do you have to trade? Your labor. You must trade your time\/effort to someone else for the resources needed to survival, again nature doesn't strictly hand them to you. \n\nWhat determines how much someone gives you for your labor? They answer is how much value they believe that you add to them. Therefore, how useful you are to another is directly proportional to the amount you paid for your work. \n\n'Woah man, not everything is strictly about economic transactions. Sometimes you add value to someone's life just by being there for them'\n\nYou know what? This is 100% true. But, it's not by your inherent value that they care about it, it's based on the time and effort you've put towards getting to know each other. Additionally, the caliber of each person will vary on how much this relationship pans out. For instance, you could be friends, close friends, with someone for decades, but they wouldn't let you sleep on their couch if you were suddenly homeless whereas other people would let you do it after only knowing you for a week or two. \n\nThe next thing someone might ask is 'well what about children'?

I don't think the 'rich people must give their money away' is good economics.\n\nUntil you are willing to give up all your luxuries, I don't think you should lecture others on giving up theirs.

I'll just say it upfront: identifying as \"x-American\" is not the same as identifying as x. Being x-American doesn't make you a spokesperson for x. I agree that the people who do that are very disrespectful, but that's not what this is. \n\nIdentifying as \"x\"-American simply means that you have significant ancestry in said country, and try to both partake in and celebrate the culture you share with the descendents of other immigrants from said country. That's it. \n\nTake Irish-Americans, for example. We've got our own history of our ancestors coming over from the famine in Ireland to climb out of poverty in the face of anti-Catholic discrimination. Is that story American? Yes. But that's not something that people with ancestry in the Mayflower or Japan can claim as their own, despite them also being as  American as I. But it doesn't stop there! We've got our own heroes, like the Irish Brigade of the Civil War. We have our own movies like \"Gangs of New York\" or \"Boondock Saints\". We have our own music, like the Dropkick Murphys. \n\nAre all these things American? Yes, absolutely. But in the same way that nobody would question that something like \"The Boondocks\" is both fully American and distinctly African-American, one should be able to understand the same of Irish-Americans. And it's the same with Italian-Americans, Greek-Americans, or what have you. \n\nWhy is this something important to Americans? Because we all grow up learning about how our ancestors came from somewhere else. Whereas people in other (non-former colonial) countries can figure their ancestors probably lived in the same general area for centuries, Americans know their ancestors have only been American for max a few centuries - and in many cases not that much. So, we Americans naturally want to know which story our ancestors come from. It's melting pot culture. \n\nIt's important, too. Historically, much of the absolute worst of racism has come from groups who try to assert themselves as \"true Americans\". That's where you get shameful histories like the KKK of the 1920's. It's telling that today's KKK portrays \"whites\" as true Americans. The concept of race is a completely artificial way of grouping people with little to nothing in common past their skin tone, but it's used to justify hate. \n\nReminding people of their immigrant roots encourages them to distance themselves from identifying themselves as \"true, white Americans\" and excluding immigrants. That's probably why (anecdotally) I've noted that first generation immigrants seem to be the most enthusiastic about identifying other Americans with their ancestry. It makes sense.  It makes them feel less out of place.\n\nTl;dr every American traces back from an immigrant group and identifying with that group is both justified and and an important part of being American.","1253":"\nI'm a guy, but the more female friends I make the more I realise this.

He had been seen and caught on camera going through a house-under-construction multiple times in the middle of the night.\n\nOn the day he was killed Arbery was seen \"jogging\" through the neighborhood again. He enters the house which a neighbor sees and calls the police, he then sprints out of the house and runs down the street. The 2 McMicheals see this and then get in their truck and chase after him, a 3rd neighbor (Roddie) sees them and gets in his truck and follows them. \n\nThe McMicheals and Roddie chase Arbery for around 4-5 minutes until we see what happens in the video - The McMicheals get ahead of Arbery and stop, Arbery runs around the truck and grabs the gun in Travis McMicheals hands. They fight over the gun and Travis ends up shooting Arbery.\n\n----\nMorally:\n\nThey didn't do anything wrong. McMichael's had good reason to suspect Arbery of committing felony burglary and any sane person seeing their friends house being broken into is going feel anger about it.\n\nThe McMicheals knew Arbery was a burglary suspect and were trying to do good on their neighbors by chasing after a suspected criminal. They weren't chasing after him to kill him, they were chasing after him to question him and detain him for the police.\n\nThey didn't shoot him because he was black. They didn't shoot him because they thought he was stealing. They shot him because he tried to grab Travis McMicheals shotgun and started punching him in the face. At that point, even if we assume the McMicheals and Rhoddie were absolutely wrong about everything before; It is completely unreasonable to say they should or could have done anything else other than defend themselves by shooting Arbery.\n\nWith Roddie it's not even a question, all he did was follow, film, and call the police. \n\n----\nLegally:\n\nThe McMichaels never actually attempted to detain Arbery. They never attacked, restrained, or pointed their weapons at him. They merely followed him whilst asking him to stop and talk.\n\nHowever, the McMichael's absolutely had reasonable and probable grounds to suspect Ahmaud Arbery of committing felony burglary. This (should have) secured them the right to detain Arbery until police could arrive and investigate. They were lawfully open carrying firearms, an inviolable right recognized by the Second Amendment and entirely reasonable when detaining a suspected fleeing felon. Rather than stopping and waiting for law enforcement to arrive, Arbery attempted to wrestle a weapon from one of them. This escalated a \"detainment\" on suspicion of burglary to putting McMichaels in fear of imminent death under which use of deadly force is permitted.\n\nAdditionally, in the trial both the prosecution and defense agreed that whether anything they did was legal depends on whether they were justified in performing a citizens arrest. The Georgia citizens arrest law is just 2 sentences:\n\n*\"A private person may arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge. If the offense is a felony and the offender is escaping or attempting to escape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion.\"*\n\nThe defense argued that the first sentence is referring to misdemeanors and the second is referring to felonies. The prosecution argued that both sentences applied to felonies. \n\nThe defenses interpretation makes sense; If it's a misdemeanor you need to have absolute certainty that a crime took place before you tackle someone to the ground. If it's a felony, and they are running away, you only need to have a reasonable suspicion that someone did something before you chase after them. Again this makes sense, it's not sensible for someone to detain a kid because they think he just shoplifted a box of cookies. It is sensible for someone to chase after a guy who looks like he just committed a murder.\n\nThe prosecutions argument doesn't; They were arguing that you need 100% certainty of any crime and **also** 51% suspicion if it's a felony before you can perform a citizens arrest. \nNot only does this not make any logical sense to be interpreted that way it does not make sense fore the state to write the law that way.\n\nWhen a situation like this occurs where there are disagreements about the interpretation of the law under the rule of lenity the judge is supposed to judge in favor of the defense. As the state had complete control over how the law was written any ambiguity should be ruled in favor of the defense. Instead what the judge did was give the jury both interpretations and let them decide. This is a horrible improper way of judging a trial.","1304":"I hate it.

By removing the expectation that women be nurturing, this social bias in rulings will be mitigated. Encouraging boys and men to embrace nurturing behaviors and creating a social environment where those behaviors are not seen as weak is definitely concordant with feminist views on the issue.\n\n\n---\n\n**Problem:** Women are more likely to be stay-at-home caregivers and to do most of the emotional labor of child rearing. When assessing the welfare of the child the parent who does most of the labor of child rearing usually gets custody, that happens to be women more often.\n \n**Feminist solution:** Women enter the workforce more often and men become stay at home dads more often. The more a man engages in the physical and emotional labor of child rearing, the more likely he will be seen as a viable candidate for custody. By creating more situations where it is clear that the father performs many of the duties of child rearing it will make a stronger case for the father keeping custody of the child.\n\n---\n\nOn top of the adequacy of these feminist solutions, I see a lot of men's rights spaces advocating a sort of traditional masculinity that at times eschews nurturing behaviors or sees staying at home to care for children as emasculating. And to those people, they can't exactly have it both ways to continue playing into a societal belief of men as emotionally distant providers and also believing that they should be granted custody of their children (who unquestionably need nurturing to develop into healthy adults).","1324":"Usually people misunderstand what s right means \n\n'I think gays are sinners'.

It truly was satisfying to watch others suffer with the same social isolation it has forced many of us into for years prior. Also, mental \"stuff\" awareness has increased since more people who previously didn't have mental health issues now have mental stuff going on (I even had to censor that? Really?!). It's almost like not only were we more prepared than the rest of society, but we basically became more accepted by it while having the last laugh. That's what y'all get for socially leaving us out because y'all were \"cool\" kids back in high school. Meanwhile, due to more mental health awareness, us people on the spectrum along with other neurodiverse people have basically just blended into the rest of society and I finally found out what it feels like to be a part of it.\n\nOn a side note, now that society no longer really cares about us being on the spectrum and therefore I got to participate in it, lemme tell you something... the mainstream American discrimination is real. Getting accepted into \"European American\" America has really taught me a lot about how people with privilege don't give a darn about the oppressed here in the USA.

They usually have a couple unfortunate things about them, maybe their parents genuinely suck, or they have a slight deformity, or poverty, or whatever.  They also supposedly have a lot of vague or normal things wrong with their lives, such as a \"shitty life\" or bad grades.  They then complain about it non stop as if it's their only personality trait until someone (usually a little younger or less privileged) comes along and agrees that they have some things wrong too.  The edgy person then adds things to their list for the younger person to relate to, until they eventually start talking about wanting to k*ll themselves, hurt themselves, start acting like they have an ED, or start using drugs.  They'll show some signs of genuinely wanting to do any of those things even if they have no intention of actually doing it.  This allows the younger\/,less privileged person to think that's how they can fix everything, and then they actually commit to some of it or find the actual help they need.  As soon as that person is gone, the edgy person finds someone else to take their place.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nThat is exactly what they're doing.

Anyone who looks at the evidence can see it was self defense yet the Prosecutor still had to argue that it wasn't, it was unwinnable from day 1.\n\nI honestly believe that if you gave this case to any Prosecutor in America they wouldn't win it. This man was given an impossible task with a case that should have never made it to trial and he did a good job when you consider that he had next to nothing to work with.","1386":"Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\n   I want to start this by saying I understand my bias. I've been living in Texas for as long as I can remember. I was raised a Christian and I still am a Christian. My family is all Christian and I've gone to church 95% of all the Sundays I've lived, although my faith still waivers every now and then so I guess I'm not super dedicated. I've tried to separate myself from my bias as well as I can but no one's perfect. I've also considered myself a right leaning centrist If that means anything.\n\n   So on to my point. I believe that if the mothers life is not in danger then abortion should not be legal. However, abortion can be considered in cases of rape. Abortion should not be considered in cases of incest unless it wasn't consensual. Abortion should be a last resort. Those are my thoughts.\n\n   I understand where people are coming from when they say that it's the mothers choice because; \"my body, my choice\". However I disagree. That lump of cells\/embryo\/first trimester\/fetus\/baby etc., Is a separate organism with its own DNA. And not just any organism. A HUMAN. No matter what you believe about a baby's consciousness, that baby will eventually become a person. So it's not \"your body\". \n\n   I feel like people are choosing to ignore this fact and are throwing aside their morals in pursuit of \"personal freedom\". Are we so bored that we're willing to kill people to find something to do?\n  \n   I feel like there's a solution we're all forgetting here. Talk. To. Some. One. That's it. Talk about your problem. If your not ready to have a baby and your condom broke or your birth control failed. Discuss it with your partner. If you can't agree on something go to a professional who can help. A doctor, Marriage\/relationship counselor, fucking gynecologist idk, dont just kill babies because it's inconvenient to you. If you can't talk to your partner because they took off or something discuss with a doctor or someone close to you that you trust. Like a parent or sibling or close friend.\n\n   If you were raped and don't think you can handle a child then discuss with a doctor, legal team, etc. Maybe you can have the child and put them up for adoption. Being in the shitty foster care system is better than not being given a chance at all.\n\n   In cases of incest that isn't rape then the proper punishment should be given to the parents of the child but abortion should still be a last resort. Custody can be given to grandparents or other family members. Adoption is still an option here too.\n\nThere are obviously an infinite amount of different circumstances that the mother of the child could be in so I'm willing to discuss in the comments, in fact I encourage it. I think we can all learn something when we stop and think instead of jumping to conclusions.\n\nI'm terrible at getting my thoughts across so I hope you understood me. Things sound great in my head and then I vomit words and hope they make sense.","1387":"[removed]","1388":"OMFG this is by far the worst emoji in all of history.

There is, at least, a lot of nuance when it comes to that issue. But outside of that situation, too often it seems like people talk about characters being shoehorned\/forced in, pandering, being overly PC, etc, and none of these things really track. Nor does it make a property bad (i.e., just because something isn't what you personally want to see doesn't mean it's bad).

Namely, that one doesn't induce the situation they're trying to claim they acted in self-defense. There's been a slew of caselaw on that topic, but the one that sticks in my mind is the case of The People v Crosbie and Meehan, where a group of youths, having had one of the group beaten up earlier, wandered the street with weapons, specifically going to the area where the violence had taken place and where those they wanted to do violence against were. This provoked the other group as they intended, a fight started, and two were killed. The Court found, quickly enough, that actively putting yourself in a situation like that, especially where one has the intent to do violence, was self-inducement, and thus, the same defense couldn't be used here.\n\nIt's not hard to see that's what happened here. We have footage of Kyle Rittenhouse only a week or two before, proclaiming how he wished he had his gun as two law-breakers fled, as he'd love to shoot them. Then, Kyle Rittenhouse would later arm himself... and head to an area like this, with what the video evidence shows is a clear intent and desire to use that weapon. \n\nIt's this fact that confirms for us that this wasn't self-defense. Nothing forced Rittenhouse to kill, he actively sought out the opportunity to do so, and thus, regardless of the lengthy debate over the footage, it can't have been self-defense.","1407":"**Disclaimer:** Of course this was not popular on unpopularopinions, and I don't expect it here either, since whenever it comes to people's comfort, ethics get the ass end of the deal\u2026\n\nMost germans didn't want to help jews during WW2 as to not make their lives more difficult and also they were promised their own financial situations would better if gotten rid of the jews.

You may or may not believe that the entire world can change its ways and move to crypto, but at the very least after this you hopefully will agree that crypto has its place in creating a more open alternative to some systems.\n\nSince I'm invested in crypto myself, I want to make it very clear that if I mention any specific crypto projects, it isn't financial advice, nor are positive or negative mentions a reason to invest in them. Do your own research if you do want to invest into crypto, but any coins or tokens that get mentioned will simply be in this thread with the purpose of providing an example.\n\nMy goal here is to educate on the premise of how blockchains and crypto work, so that people understand, besides the millions of scams that do exist, there are great projects working on great things, and maybe some of you might be inclined to try out some projects without even expecting any gains!\n\n**So first of all, what are blockchains?**\n\nBlockchains are simply distributed ledgers and computing systems. Now those are two fancy words that essentially mean they are systems, spread across the globe, running on many computers and servers, that track data, as well as allow their users to perform any tasks defined within their specifications. This can be as simple as adding two numbers, or handling a *smart contract* that only pays out insurance money if certain requirements are met. We'll get back to these later.\n\nThe benefit of having all the data, and code, running on a distributed system, is that everything is transparent. This doesn't always mean that I can read how much of a certain crypto got sent or received from each wallet, but the code can verify that you're allowed to perform certain transactions, and this is done by multiple people to ensure that trust doesn't need to really exist, since a large portion of people running and validating the network need to agree. This makes blockchains trustless.\n\n**How does crypto play into this?**\n\nCryptocurrencies are coins or tokens built on top of blockchains. It's very important to understand the difference between a cryptocoin, and a cryptotoken.\n\nEach blockchain needs a way to incentivize those distributed computers and servers I mentioned. Since they're running the computational tasks, and storing all the data on the ledger, they get paid in a cryptocoin. For the Bitcoin network this is BTC, for Ethereum it's ETH, etc. Those fees are usually paid when a transaction is ran on the network, so i.e. if I send from my wallet to yours some ETH, then a transaction fee must be paid and a part of which gets paid to the miners that enabled this transaction to go through, the rest of the transaction fee is destroyed, making ETH deflationary in this case.\n\nThere's a lot more that can go into the economics of a cryptocoin, or token. Some of it I might bring up later. In any case, now to the tokens.\n\nTokens are representations of real-world assets, or completely digital assets, built on top of a blockchain. As they aren't used to pay transaction fees, and aren't built natively on the blockchain they reside on, we call them tokens instead of coins. This could even be something like a house deed, or the ownership certificate of a vehicle, etc. These tokens don't even need to only exist on one blockchain. They can be coded to exist on multiple, such as Solana, Ethereum and Cardano.\n\nNow, not all blockchains make it possible to create a token on their network. Each blockchain has its own approach, often giving the creator of a token a reason to pick one or the other blockchain for their project.\n\n**How can tokens help us?**\n\nWell, a big use-case I see in blockchain technology right now is the use of tokens, which is why it's getting a dedicated section. As I mentioned, tokens are just assets, either representing something in the real-world, or entirely digital. I can tokenize my house deed, as I mentioned, or generate a bunch of even tickets with the right blockchain. Then sell the whole thing digitally, in a trustless and low-fee manner compared to traditional centralized systems.\n\nThose are just some examples I wanted to quickly mention on how tokens can actually have real-world use. On top of that, think about the games we play. LoL accounts, among others, can be sold for thousands of dollars because of the items they possess. Now, some might call it a bubble, or simply dumb, but it shows, that we humans are capable of attributing arbitrary value, to the oddest of things. The same can be seen in certain artwork (IMO, but those buying the art probably see it in a very different light) and playing cards for soccer\/football or Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nAll those, more playful, systems, can be tokenized and gamified on blockchain as well. I can write a smart contract that generates a very specific set of cards, which are used in a PvP game, and the better a card's attributes are, the higher likelihood it has in winning a tournament. That's a very basic, and general example of what I'm trying to explain, but hopefully it makes sense.\n\n**What are smart contracts?**\n\nSmart contracts are what really make blockchains as capable as they are today, IMHO. A very straightforward explanation is that a smart contract is some code, that only does something when certain parameters are met. That's why it's called a smart contract, because it only executes its main task, after the contract is signed so to speak. Depending on the blockchain you're working on, smart contracts will have different capabilities, but there are some crazy use-cases for them that I bet some of you will find interesting.\n\nThis is where we get a bit more technical. To really understand how great a smart contract can be, you need to know that this code gets deployed on a blockchain by whoever created it, and gets a wallet address of its own just like you or I would on which it can accept transactions or even send them. This means smart contracts can interact with the crptocoins and tokens I mentioned earlier. A smart contract can also keep track of data, kind of like an Excel sheet on the blockchain, that is fully transparent and open. It's trustless, like I said, because you can view the code before interacting with it, to ensure that it truly will do what its creator claims it should.\n\nBecause smart contracts have the capabilities I mentioned above, they can be used to validate the authenticity of certain assets. As I mentioned above, those gaming cards would be created by a smart contract, and since the smart contract only does exactly what it's told to do, people can verify that the card is real, by checking if its original creator was the smart contract that runs the game.\n\nOn top of that, smart contracts can be used for more than just games. They can be used for voting, open and publicly ran insurances, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), liquidity and swapping protocols, lending protocols, etc.\n\nAll those get even more technical. A decentralized autonomous organization, is exactly what it sounds like. A company that doesn't have a CEO, or anyone running its operations. Everything that happens in that company is executed via code. If the smart contract is supposed to change, to e.g. support new features or use-cases, then people would first have to vote on it. The voting systems are always different as well, but a popular example is MakerDAO, which created its own token that people can hold to get voting rights. So essentially anyone can make business decisions by holding the token. This is a popular approach in crypto governance in general.\n\nLiquidity, swapping and lending protocols have to do with DeFi. DeFi stands for decentralized finance, and is a whole new world of taking over the tasks from traditional banks, and putting them on the blockchain. Instead of earning interest through the middleman, who takes a cut, you add your liquidity to a liquidity pool on the blockchain, and make far higher returns. This can even be done with stablecoins, which are essentially coins or tokens pegged to a fiat currency value, so you don't have to worry about the volatility of crypto.\n\nSwapping protocols allow people to trade between currencies without a middleman as well. Instead of a centralized exchange buying millions of crypto so that they have the liquidity when you want to buy it, a DEX (decentralized exchange) will use smart contracts to have the community pool this liquidity, and anyone that adds liquidity, just like with the above mentioned lending protocols, makes a good amount of fees for the risk and effort. I must add that the risk is usually extremely low with well-established DEXes.\n\nI could go on about crypto all day. But the last two things I want to mention, is that crypto really could help some third-world countries, but even first-world countries in a meaningful way. The Cardano developers have been partnering with African nations to introduce better ways in tracking education data, voting turnouts, etc. using blockchain. These systems will be somewhat closed, as they probably will be ran by the government, but they will be leveraging the same blockchain technology we see here in the public system.\n\nOn top of that, there are blockchain projects working on early implementations of UBI. If we can ensure that everyone only signs up to said blockchain once, then we can pay out a certain basic income rate which is something some first-world countries direly need in this time of automation.\n\n**Touching on the Metaverse.**\n\nI just want to make a quick note on the Metaverse, as recently it has been a controversial topic with Facebook's rebranding and the parabolic price action of related cryptocurrencies. I think it's interesting, and again, just like traditional games are able to put certain value on items, the Metaverse wants to build a decentralized digital world. So whether you like it or not is up to you, but it's kind of like playing VRChat on steroids. Along with the financial incentives, people are just going to do what they can to get in early. So maybe it's something for you!\n\n**Wrapping up.**\n\nI will admit, blockchain tech, and crypto, still has a long ways to go as of right now. There are some great projects out there building on some awesome ideas, but it's worth nothing that Ethereum still runs on PoW, which uses a fair bit of energy. Luckily, most modern blockchains use PoS, which doesn't, and Ethereum 2.0 will be migrating to it. There are other concerns, such as interoperability, and centralization, that will need to be addressed by projects, to bring crypto into the mainstream. But I think it's worth keeping this technology on your radar, as it might just have the same effect that the internet did to bring knowledge, media and many more opportunities to a wider mass.\n\nThat's all for my explanation on cryptocurrencies. I've written a previous thread going over some of the [myths about blockchain technology and crypto](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueUnpopularOpinion\/comments\/qs6v2b\/crypto_isnt_just_a_trading_game_or_a_gamble_and\/), if you guys are interested. My approach has always been to try and educate people. I don't want to change your minds, if everything I wrote here still has you convinced that crypto isn't for you, that's okay. But I hope everyone makes an informed decision, instead of following influencers and politicians, since they always have a stake, that will go against most of us here.","1427":"This post is definitely inspired by a recent argument on Reddit. But as a software engineer with an interest in crypto and where it's headed, I'm just incredibly bothered by the misinformation being spread by people that seem to just be throwing a tantrum that they couldn't invest into BTC when it wasn't worth anything. Then there's also people who like to talk about shit that they don't know jack about. It really is the embodiment of the \"I don't know shit about fuck,\" meme combined with some \"If those kids could read they would be very angry.\"\n\nTo address some of the points made by people against crypto.\n\n***\"Oh but crypto just puts power and control into a different hand, instead of the government.\"***\n\nYes, **you**. Literally you control crypto, its value and the fluctuations, market circulation by using it. Crypto is entirely open. You can go read the code that you run on your own computer to join the blockchain network to make sure that no foul code has been added to break the system. Literally thousands of people do so on a daily basis which is what makes it so secure.\n\nGovernments have no safeguards or checks to ensure that they actually operate in our interests. [Inflation during the pandemic was five percent because governments care more about short-term economic revival than long-term sustainability.](https:\/\/www.rochester.edu\/newscenter\/what-is-inflation-is-there-economic-crisis-485642\/)\n\nBlockchains for larger cryptocurrencies such as the Bitcoin network run on millions of machines already. For a hacker to steal or add money they would need to affect at least 50% of every node in this setup. With traditional banks and currencies we're giving institutions and governments a ton of say in our own holdings and essentially providing them with ownership unless you're holding a physical asset like gold or an estate.\n\n***\"Crypto will make it easier for rich people to get even richer, and conduct shady business.\"***\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, cryptocurrencies run on blockchains that are held by millions of people on the world. Joining the network is easy, and you can take a look at the ledger of BTC, SOL, XMR, ETH, etc. easily to see what the movements look like.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic a lot of millionaires and billionaires made their riches by transferring their assets to safer investments knowing that the economy would be hit hard during this time. In a world running on crypto it would be impossible to hide such large movements, and one could even create bots to use this transparency to monitor the global financial market in a way that evens the playing field for people that aren't connected to those circles.\n\nNot to mention, while crypto can be anonymous, most of them aren't and it isn't hidden behind any locked doors. It's incredibly easy to find out who the owner of most crypto-wallets are. There are only a few exceptions of privacy oriented wallets such as XMR but those have a different use-case that is by far less shady than what we currently have with financial institutions such as banks and investment firms.\n\n***\"Crypto is a scam! I've seen countless breaches and ponzi schemes.\"***\n\nScams exist right now, too. All it takes is a shitty website disguised as a bank or online retailer to get your account information and steal thousands of dollars. This happens pretty much every minute to thousands of people across the globe. Crypto is no different. In fact, I'd argue that people who take crypto seriously, inform themselves before getting into it also get better at IT security and protecting their passwords, accounts, and files, due to the slightly steeper learning curve for getting into crypto compared to other assets and its technical nature.\n\n***\"Crypto will enable the rich to get richer and further increase the wealth gap.\"***\n\nThe rich are already way ahead of us. But crypto doesn't make this worse, and if anything this sounds like an argument to invest IMHO. I'm not saying anyone should buy crypto, that's not the point of this post at all. But it's just not an issue that crypto is creating or making worse, even. It's a different asset to invest in, and thanks to its transparency at least we can monitor large wallets to understand what the wealthy people are doing if we're so convinced that they know something we don't. With traditional assets you have no idea whatsoever about what's going on and who is preparing for the next doomsday.\n\n***\"Crypto is bad for the environment, and takes away clean energy that could be used elsewhere.\"***\n\nThis would have been true at the start of the crypto and in particular, Bitcoin, mining phase. People were spending insane amounts of money on mining farms, GPUs, wasting energy and such, but things have changed.\n\nFirst of all, [Bitcoin mining, while still a thing, is running on nearly 60% green energy, a number that's only increasing.](https:\/\/www.livemint.com\/market\/cryptocurrency\/use-of-green-energy-in-bitcoin-mining-jumped-to-56-in-june-quarter-report-11625212165534.html) That makes it one of the main industries that primarily relies on clean power sources and is on a trajectory of becoming carbon neutral, while many other applications that waste a lot more power are still stuck on coal and nuclear energy. Not only that, Bitcoin mining actually gets most of its energy from excess produced in countries such as Iceland which means no one is being denied renewable energy since no one actually seems to care to use it except miners.\n\nSecond point. Bitcoin mining is one of the few wasteful consensus strategies still being used at a larger scale. Other, more modern currencies, such as SOL, XMR, ETH, DOT, etc. use proof of stake mechanisms to validate transactions, which can be ran with very little energy and actually still are profitable for retail investors. Bitcoin mining is only profitable if you run ASICS in a large server farm and have cheap energy and infrastructure fees.\n\nThere are cryptos that still run on proof of work validation mechanisms, or even some more exotic file-based ones that ruin hard drives. But as someone that invests into crypto with the future in mind, I doubt that people will be taking those seriously for the long-term when they're already released with a disadvantage to their core systems.\n\n***\"Crypto is only used for investing and trading, it will never be a real currency.\"***\n\nThat's literally your fault, though. If you buy crypto just to hodl it for a year and leave, then you're part of the problem. There's evidence that wallets made within the previous 90 days will quickly sell when the crypto market starts dipping. Any wallets that exist longer than that seem to hold on to their assets for ages because they genuinely believe in crypto being the next big thing.\n\nI know of far more people that see crypto as a currency they want to use in the future as a proper replacement for fiat. Stores online already offer incentives for using BTC, Tesla even accepts it as a payment method, while Twitter is adding it for their rewards scheme. Even Reddit now has a token on the Ethereum network to handle their premium memberships and community rewards. Check out the Reddit vault if you haven't yet. For mobile users it's in the side menu below your settings and profile menu options. The underlying blockchain technology used by crypto can be used for even more decentralized apps, such as content sharing networks, Solana already has dapps designed for artists, while DAAG is working on their decentralized stock exchange network on Solana as well, and the potential is nearly limitless.\n\nSo yeah, as I said. I don't want anyone to use this post as an incentive to buy crypto. I'm not saying you should. But please, inform yourself if you are going to criticize it, and use valid point. Crypto is a polarizing topic, so a lot of misinformation is spread on a daily basis and headlines are designed to infuriate some while exciting others. That's just how the news works. But crypto has a technical nature, which makes it easy to examine with an objective point of view. Make use of that and start making informed decisions about your finances instead of getting angry at the system and not doing anything about it. This is your chance to be independent from some of the biggest and most unethical institutions out there.","1428":"[deleted]","1429":"Everyone hates China. I get it.

A bio mom that puts the new born into the foster care system shouldn't be allowed to take the kid back. The kid should quickly be given to a family that want the kid for life. It's not good for kids to keep switching environments. We should do what's best for the kid, and I don't think the mom\/dad getting the kid back is good for them. Yet everyone says that because of biology that these bio parents should have legal claim to the kid. \n\nPeople also say preventing people from having kids, whether through social pressure or other means is a bad thing. I don't feel sorry confining a serial killer in prison alone where he cannot reproduce. Similarly, I wouldn't see a problem if we had laws or policies that prevent unfit parents from having kids. For example, one child policy, or taxing people for every kid they have over the second. \n\nIf we argue people should be able to decide our own life, I would agree. But the mentality isn't consistent. If people want the government to layoff how many kids we can have, then they should layoff on how kids are raised? It's either it's moral to let the government control your kids life, ie mandatory education (yes even homeschooled kids need to show they are progress) or the government is immoral for control. \n\nAlso, lets say in a futuristic world we have a pill that makes you infertile. No side effect, nothing. The only way to go back to being fertile is an antidote that the government gives you an antidote so you can have kids. The unpopular opinion is people think it's creepy for the government to control your sex life. It's no different than sex work being regulated, and also I just don't see how it's creepy to prevent the harm that a child may face. \n\nI also don't see why it's so 'wrong' to say poor people shouldn't have kids. I'm broke, I'm not gonna have kids. It's as simple as that. If I were 16 and unable to raise a child, I should not consciously and knowingly have sex to have a kid just because I 'want' one. I know people say a lot of kids in poverty are because of lack of education and contraception. If you are so dumb you don't know that having sex could lead to a child, then I can agree. But if you know that, then it's on you that your kid is suffering, and you disgust me. Lack of contraception isn't an excuse from adults. \n\nHonestly, my biggest issue, and I've tried on changing my view subs and stuff, but I just fail to see why raising a kid is a right. People want kids isn't a good reason for it to be a 'right'. And people want makeup and jewelry and whatever. A kid isn't something that should be seen as 'I want, therefore I should get'.

You don't just \"believe\" whatever the person handing you the gun says, and even when you've checked the action and ensured the gun is safe you **never point it at anyone for any reason, let alone do so and pull the trigger**. On a movie set *maybe* you point a safe weapon at another actor, but you certainly aren't wildly pointing it around at cinematographers and directors and pulling the trigger like it's a game.\n\nThere's really no excuse for Baldwin.

It's also incredibly hypocritical just to use a gun when he has been so much against people using guns. \n\nI hope he feels terrible for having killed this woman.","1536":"[removed]","1537":"Like you need to realize that most people meet at their work, most people meet naturally through mutual friends, etc. etc. It isn't some big thing that happens.

It fucking isn't a big deal. A relationship almost always develops naturally over time, starts with friendship. And it naturally progresses, this is 99% of relationships that ever happened or will happen in the future. It isn't a big deal and it isn't dramatic. And you don't have to try to get with someone it just happens. It just fucking happens. Can you understand what I'm saying?\n\nIt just happens naturally. \n\nNow as far as the whole idea that ugly people or average people can't get  a date, I call bullshit.

Go around whining about how they can't get a date. You know how boring that is to listen to someone whining about that stuff? Considering they could be doing something about it instead? Who wants to put up with that?\n\nI am willing to acknowledge someone with social anxiety and other issues, but they should be doing the best they can despite those issues. Because what the fuck else are they going to do, wallow in pity? Again, women don't like that, and neither do men btw.\n\nSo yeah, that's about it really. I put this as 'unpopular on reddit' not because there's a big INCEL population here (there isn't - not anymore as far as I know) but I read shit on here all the time on dating subs, and other subreddits like foreveralone where they just wallow in self-pity and it isn't even real what they believe. Like if they really had zero chance of ever getting a date, I'd think that'd be sad and they could be sad about it, but that isn't reality and it never will be. Nobody has zero chance besides people who aren't even trying. \n\nAnd here's one more thing, you really should be focusing on yourself since you clearly have issues unrelated to other people and women, like being socially awkward is one thing but having no self-esteem is a whole other deal and that's your thing to work on nobody elses.

A gun's sole purpose is to kill. (Or, you could say injure, but essentially kill). That is its purpose. At the very least, it is used for destruction. The reason I struggle with understanding \"gun enthusiasts\" is because essentially, you're collecting\/obsessing over a tool used to kill others. Though you hopefully will not have to kill anyone with it yourself, that is what it does.\n\nI look at it as some twisted eventuality of us being granted the right to have them (in other words, of course at some point, having access to them, this was bound to happen), but at the end of the day, the idea that someone is so gung-ho about owning something with such a purpose is what feels off.

You could've spent your life persecuting Christians, murdering, raping, molesting, any of the most evil crimes, but if you ask Jesus Christ for forgiveness and to be your saviour, you're heaven bound by his mercy.\n\nHowever, one thing common in all the variants of Christianity I've seen is that fetuses, incapable of getting baptized or asking for forgiveness, go to heaven if they die, be it by miscarriage or abortion.\n\nBecause of this, we have two simple facts: if you, a non-Christian, get an abortion, you're no less hell-bound than if you didn't, so there's really no effect on where you'll end up, and if you later become Christian, you'll be going to heaven either way. Meanwhile, if you're aborted, you're definitely going to Heaven, while if you're born, there's a high chance, something like 68% if I recall, that you won't be Christian and will end up going to hell.\n\nHence, it's pretty clear: abortion is a net good. You're vastly reducing the fetuses chance of going to Hell and guaranteeing it heaven, at no cost to the mortal soul of the mother. The most objective good would be for a mother to have as many abortions as possible, as this creates the greatest number of souls that get to go to heaven and experience bliss, before eventually asking for forgiveness. Hell, even if God gets annoyed at this loophole and refuses to forgive the woman, one soul going to Hell for the dozens of aborted souls going to heaven far outweighs the cost.\n\nThis is all predicated on Christian theology being correct, of course, and falls away with out it, but it's an interesting argument I've never seen addressed.","1589":"[removed]","1590":"[removed]","1591":"[removed]","1592":"[removed]","1593":"[removed]","1594":"[removed]","1595":"He was sent here to fan the flames of culture war, sow distrust in our democracy, and destroy our nation from within. This is my opinion, and I\u2019m not pretending to have conclusive evidence, but here are the reasons why I believe this:\n\nIn 2016, his campaign officials and family members met with Russians in Trump tower for the purpose of exchanging \u201cdirt\u201d on his opponent. Whether anything came of this or not, the parties involved admit that the meeting occurred and didn\u2019t deny what the purpose of the meeting was. It\u2019s unlikely that this is the first time the two sides made contact. This meeting lines up with a pattern of behavior that either directly or indirectly supports the Russian agenda of weakening America from within. \n\n[Throughout 2016, Trump claimed the election would be rigged](https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.bbc.com\/news\/election-us-2016-37673797.amp)\n\nAfter his victory, he abandoned the election fraud claims and continued to work for Russia from the Oval Office. He supported Russia\u2019s agenda abroad, withdrawing support for Ukraine and the Kurds. He also publicly supported Putin\u2019s agenda and had a much less contentious relationship with Putin than any former president. \n\nWhile in office he criticizes free press. Anytime the media is critical of him, he calls it \u201cfake news\u201d. His campaign against the media is meant push people to listing to and trusting him (the government) for information, rather than the free press which does not have to respond to the government. He also wants to compel right-winged media to tailor their reports to not upset him, causing him to tell his supporters to change the channel. If the media has to concern itself with the president\u2019s opinion before running a story, they are not free press anymore. Russian media responds to the government, American media has always only responded to one thing: money. \n\nThroughout his time in office and the election cycle (which doesn\u2019t truly end for Trump, since he continues to do campaign-style rallies even outside of the normal election cycle) he campaigns on the idea that the other side will destroy the country, and specifically his supporters way of life, if he loses. He tells people they should fear being replaced by immigrants and those who want \u201cdiversity\u201d. \n\nAlso throughout 2019 and 2020, he regularly said that even after he wins, he should be allowed a 3rd term because of how \u201cpoorly he was treated\u201d. Many people dismissed this as a joke, but there are many supporters who would only vote for him and would definitely support a 3rd term. He wants to remain in office as long as possible. \n\nIn 2020, the election fraud claims came back and when he lost, he claimed the election was stolen from him. He told supporters to gather at the Capitol and convince congress to overturn the election, which is not something the rules allow them to do. All of his attempts to overturn the election from Election Day to January 6th would have been unconstitutional. \n\nNow, he sends out emails to his supporters saying that if we don\u2019t \u201csolve\u201d the 2020 election fraud, republicans won\u2019t vote in 2022 or 2024. This is a message to his supporters that there\u2019s no reason to partake in American democracy, and a message to Republican politicians that if they don\u2019t support his election fraud campaign, he will turn against them. He is also isolating members of the Republican Party who don\u2019t believe the election was stolen, creating a party of people who don\u2019t trust anyone in government or media besides him. \n\nHe is currently holding \u201csave America\u201d rallies, entirely focused on the \u201cissue\u201d of solving the stolen 2020 election. All of his actions push us closer and closer to civil war. There are millions of people on the \u201cright\u201d who believe our country is already lost and democracy is broken, but that\u2019s simply not true at this point. If we allowed him to have his way and Congress\/Mike Pence unconstitutionally overturn the results of the election, their fears would have come true. \n\nThe Cold War never ended, the battleground just changed. Russia is the same government that wants to be their region\u2019s unopposed superpower, and America is still a roach for them that\u2019s impossible to kill with violence or the threat of violence. What\u2019s the best way to destroy the most diverse superpower in the world? Use that diversity against them and make them fight themselves. Re-ignite the flames of the Civil War and the unresolved conflicts between different factions. I\u2019m confident that Trump isn\u2019t the only Russian agent in our government, but he is certainly the most effective. He is by far the most polarizing figure in America today and the disruption he causes is exactly what the Russian government wants.","1596":"These people have already tried to overthrow a free and fair election.

Well, we have a lot of sources, including Roman historians and early multiple Christian authors.  At least a dozen.\n\nIn fact our problem isn't a lack of information it's too much really - one source says he was stoned, another stoned and beaten , and another just says he was beaten.  There's also some confusion because there was multiple people named James.  But on the main points, there is widespread agreement.\n\n\n##Jesus \n\nOn to Jesus.  Of course, we have the Christian sources - the four Gospels, any of which would be considered primary source material.  Then we have the Roman historians, Tacitus and Josephus.  These aren't just random guys - Tacitus was a Governor, Senator, and even a Consul, and Josephus worked for Emperor Titus.\n\nBoth Tacitus and Josephus are in agreement on the main points - Jesus Christ taught and founded Christianity,  was condemned by Herod (Pontius Pilate), and crucified by the Romans.  Josephus also confirms the baptism of Jesus (by John the Baptist). Bottom line is that you can doubt some of the details, but you can't doubt that Jesus existed unless you deliberately apply an impossible high standard to him, specifically.\n\n##Resurrection\n\nOk, fair enough, you're thinking, so Jesus was a real guy who was baptized, started a new religion, and was crucified.  But there's no evidence that he performed miracles, or was resurrected, right?  RIGHT?\n\nHaving multiple eyewitness accounts of a historical event that was witnessed by dozens or even hundreds of people is a historians dream, and that's exactly where we are on the resurrection.  According to the gospels, the tomb was empty, and Jesus made as many as five appearances to his family members, disciples, and even a crowd of people.  And according to Josephus, yes Jesus did rise from the dead, so that's third-party (non-Christian) confirmation.\n\nIf it wasn't the resurrection, nobody would doubt it's authenticity..

It's not broken, it's not malicious, and it isn't at fault for your bad spending habits.\n\nCapitalism at its core is based on the idea of economic freedom. Freedom is not a regulation nor a solution. It is the natural state of any economy before rules and regulations are applied. Capitalism allows room for prosperity for anyone, and poverty for anyone. It envelops both the good and the bad.\n\nIn my opinion, you all should be hating on Communism and Corporatism. Corporations strongly resemble Communist states in that they aggregate resources under singular, draconic control, and have very little or impersonal regard for their members and employees. Everything is done with the interest of the Company (under the pretense of everyone benefitting) in mind. That's a Communist state.\n\nUnder Capitalism, anything can happen. You could thrive, or you could fall. It's up to you and chance. It's not the fault of Capitalism if you let corporations buy all the land and houses, and then rent them out at an extortionate premium. If you don't like it, don't sell.\n\nCapitalism allows for those things, but it also allows for you to legislate local (state level) laws on land ownership, as well as setting the value of the property low and using Eminent Domain to buy it all back for pennies on the dollar.\n\nYou can't blame economic tyranny on economic freedom.","1665":" \n\nI was watching this video that was from a while back of a woman on a NJ Transit train who was sitting in one seat,  and her Louis Vuitton was parked in the seat next to her. \n\nPeople  were giving her a hard time because she wasn't allowing anyone to sit  next to her.

EVERYONE paid for a  ticket. The only thing it entitles you to is to be transported from one  station to the next. That's it, no more no less.\n\n2. There are  other seats available, always.  I suggest you try somewhere else instead  of DEMANDING that one person let you sit next to them. As rude as she  sounded, she's right. If she doesn't want someone sitting next to her,  she has every right to say no. She's entitled to her personal space, and  the fact that \"it's public transportation\" is not relevant. \n\n3.  Why did the person recording it even see it fit to record to begin with?  Doesn't she have anything better to do aside from shaming someone for  not thinking the way she thinks? This is America.

Globalism by its very nature, as a product of it's far reach and impact, is one of the most significant factors polluting the oceans, the air, the land and environmental systems. You cannot, with any intellectual honesty, say you support globalism while also claiming you want to improve issues with climate change and environmental degradation. However, despite this, it is very common today to run across people who claim they want to improve the environment, but then at the same time advocate for unrestrained globalism.

I'm Italian and, you know, not so good English skills.\n\nThis though that I have has formed seeing how ignorant and uncultured are most of the elderly people in my country. They can't elaborate a personal way of thinking that isn't \"imposed\" by someone else.\nFor example:\nSalvini is the leader of Lega, one of the top parties in Italy. _\"Boomers\"_ follows him just because their minds are too lazy to elaborate what he's actually saying.\n10 years ago Salvini was supporting Padanian secession and he said that Italy is a shithole of a country, that southern Italians are fucking pigs and things like that. Nowadays he's a ultranationalist who loves southern Italy and that says that people from Africa are fucking pigs and stuff like that. Basically he's followed and he got lot of consent because he know what people want and he says what people want.\n\nSalvini isn't the only party leader to do this. Also PD (Italian democratic party), M5S (populists), Fratelli d'Italia (ultra right wing) and Forza Italia (Right market liberals) are fucking shitty parties that decieve ignorant people to follow them just because they know what to tell to electors.\n\nI saw lot of young people (18-30) that fucking hate this system. 7 out of 10 people that are under 30 don't vote anymore.\nThey're fucking tired of those parties that exist only because _\"boomers\"_ vote them.\n\nWe can't have a fucking good party that says the truth and that want what is truly good for Italy.\n\nNowadays Italian politics can be summarized in:\n\n\"Left\"wing: Lmao those Right-wing fuckers are dumb as hell, they're fascists.\n\nRightwing: Lmao those Left-wing fuckers are so fucking stupid, they're commies.\n\nItaly don't have a true Left-wing anymore, Even PD (top \"left\"wing party) it's a fucking joke. They're considered _LeFt_ because they support LGBT rights. Nothing more. That's all.\n\nWe don't have a good Socialist\/Communist party since the current ones always do things just to have 2-3 seats in the parliament. They care about the seats not the people.\nWe don't have a good liberal party since the current one is a fucking joke that cares only about free market and dont give a shit about civil rights.\nWe don't have a good rightwing conservative party since the current ones only cares to spread shit about immigrants and to exploit that sort of \"Boomer's-Nostalgia\" that most of over60 have.\n\nOur political system is fucked up because parties only point to recieve votes from ignorant, dumb, lazyminds _\"boomers\"_ that can't understand what kind of shit they're voting.\n\nIn Italy, the elderly are the largest demographic category and the most ignorant. Less than 50% of them have a highschool degree and school before highschool only teaches you how to write, basic math and 0 to none literature.\n\nI'm not surprised to see my country rolling down to the bottom of the abyss if we give to those dumbfucks that can't even speak properly the right to vote.\n\nVote it's not only a right, it's also a responsibility. You're fucking asked to decide the future of a country. Don't get surprised if populists are winning. They talk to the stomach of ignorant people that electorally worth as much as you.

It's borderline abuse.","1725":"I make an effort to stay informed on the opinions of those on the left and the right. One of the ways I do this is by watching content creators on youtube from all across the political sphere. When I do this, I try to find the most reasonable who can put together the best arguments to represent different viewpoints.\n\nThere are a couple problems. For one, the overtun window keeps shifting further and further right. It's a key, and very effective, part of the fascist\u2019s strategy. This means that more and more people, without their actual views changing at all, are being labelled left leaning when they were previously considered right leaning.\n\nThe second problem is the one alluded to in the title, and it's pretty closely related to the first. People keep being pushed out of right wing social groups for having opinions that even slightly differ from the group, or for incredibly petty stuff that either has nothing to do with politics or is informed by their right wing views. Stuff\u2019s crazy.\n\nFor example, when righties accuse me of being left wing for watching people like Young Turks, I point out how I also watch people like Neo-Nazis and QAnon. Now don't get me wrong, all of these people believe a lot of crazy and incredibly stupid stuff, but they at least make fully formed arguments for their beliefs (less so with QAnon, but he's the best evangelical politics guy I've found so I can't ditch him).\n\nHowever, Liz Cheney has been canceled for not falling for the Big Lie, and it's only a matter of time before Mitt Romney gets cancelled for being a pedo or some stuff. Now people are calling Liz forking Deep State and the only people these days who are considered right wing are the clinically insane people on YouTube like PragerU.\n\nAnd that's kind of the point. By shunning anyone but the most extreme, they push the overtun window further and further which makes normies thing the extreme views are more normal, so they adopt them more.\n\nI consider myself a centrist. I have very strong views on most major political topics, but they don't align with either the left or the right. Sometimes I agree with things that are strictly right wing ideas, and sometimes I agree with things that are strictly left wing. But having said that, the right really is toxic as hell. The left always seems to be the more understanding and reasonable side. I'm not going to just start agreeing with them because they're nice, but it is worth pointing out.","1726":"So whenever we are going to listen to music in school, 90% of the boys want to listen to rap and hip hop only.

But to be honest, throughout my research and gathering of this process... I am willing to accept every outcome headed my way.\n\nAfter looking around at r\/HermanCainAward, especially with it's growth (whether by the recent articles or not), as a fond person of researching I decided to tackle the claims the people make that say that sub is bad because it celebrates death. This is accompanied by them stating that it breaks the rules of Reddit. Mainly Rule 1. So in order to tackle these claims, I present to you this post.\n\nFirst let's go over, **Rule 1**\n\n>Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. ***Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.***\n\n[Inciting violence](https:\/\/www.reddithelp.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360043513151) and [the hate sections](https:\/\/www.reddithelp.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360045715951) have hyperlinks in them so they can provide examples in terms of context.\n\nThis is what people who dislike the sub form their basis on breaking ToS. This rule thanks to it's last section on both grounds. So now let's dissect them one by one.\n\nFirst, **inciting violence**. To incite by definition [thanks to webster](https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/incite#:~:text=transitive%20verb,up%20%3A%20spur%20on%20%3A%20urge%20on), it is to encourage, urge, or stir up. Is the sub encouraging Anti-Vaxxers to die? No, absolutely not. The majority of the posts are post screen caps which critique anti-vaxxers and showcase how COVID disinformation kills. The posts with the caps are catalogued in chronological order, starting from people believing in disinformation about COVID to either their demise or their realization. How is basing something off of a poster showcasing another persons history \"inciting violence\"?\n\nThis is the easiest to debunk. How easy? Is the OP of the post voicing their opinion of them? No. It's just their history. The fact they have no thoughts about the person and that they are showcasing the person's life is not encouraging violence. If that's the case, most history subs would be banned\n\nIf you still don't believe me, go into any of the posts and look at the criteria I posed. As in look back at that same webster definition and see if it applies to comments.\n\nPlus consider the second rule of that sub, which is \"don't root for nominees to be awarded\". If that comment is inciting, the mods will report it and take it down because that's wishing death, promoting it, which is against Reddit's rules. They know that comments that promote death can get banned, plus [considering the nature that this sub doesn't want to exist but because of them are anyway](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/HermanCainAward\/comments\/psyp4w\/for_those_who_say_the_hca_are_immoral_lets_see\/), it's right for them to do to enforce that rule.\n\nNext, **hate based on identity**. How Reddit identifies hate by identity falls under these categories and I quote;\n\n>based on their actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability. These include victims of a major violent event and their families.\u00a0\n\nThis other bad faith argumentation of the sub is on the grounds of their own political identity, because apparently it is now a political side. This is tricky to dissect. While one could argue political identity being a part of the many examples of hate on identity, I argue against that.\n\nIf we want to go further into this let's look at the possible counter-argument, [did you know that companies can deny you because of your political beliefs?](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tomspiggle\/2021\/02\/24\/is-political-discrimination-in-the-workplace-legal\/?sh=7778d88c68dd) [This extends more to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.](https:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/statutes\/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964) This would be a no-shit moment if you've been banned in political subs where your ideals are different from the majority but this is reality. That is not the case with here.\n\nWhy not? If I am honest, while I can make a case that a company denying a person thanks to their political views is discrimination, in a case like this subreddit and other related areas to it, it's very different.\n\nOne is a job that require humans to work for to ensure their livelihood, the other is just a club with no purpose. One is about working for change for your right to paycheck, the other is goofing off. You see? One is client to client for their needs, the other is just not about the needs and is only one-party.\n\nThat sub is that other. It's not providing needs to other people out of necessity. Jobs vs subs are very different.\n\nAlso for the main meat to connect this; political identity's change over time as we grow and develop new takes on situations, one idea today could be a bad one later. Political affiliations swing from human to human as we get older or we get exposed to new identity's. To put it bluntly, the things Reddit listed such as race, identity, gender, sex, disability are all things we can't change. Political affiliation we can change. So why discriminate when we can change affiliations?\n\nThe virus has no political sides, this virus took the left and the right, even some anti-vaxxers are left wings too but very very rarely is that the case. Even if the majority is the opposition, it's not hate because you can change it. If you can't change it and that's your personality\/life\/body, it's hate. That's in layman's terms Reddit provided.\n\nTL;DR: That sub **does not** violate Reddit ToS. The incitement is not there, and the hatred is non-existent. That sub is all a PSA about how disinformation in today's society can kill by showcasing a person's life. Call it a memorial, call it a scared straight message, but it isn't a place to dance at deaths.\n\nAlso I find it ironic that for people on Reddit who hate this sub (mainly some on the opposition) are also Free Speech Warriors. It's funny really, you claim to support Free Speech but be willing to ban this sub... That's funny.","1771":"[deleted]","1772":"Everyone likes to shit on fortnite but I have a blast playing it.

Sometimes, it's for some crazy shit PETA is doing, but for the vast majority of times, it's clear people just enjoy getting annoyed or angry at vegans easier. It's never made sense to me. Veganism isn't a choice that effects other people. If anything, given veganism has less of an environmental impact, it's considerably better for those around you to be vegan.\n\nYet, the anger persists. Why? Well, it's pretty simple. People feel insecure, because they're aware that meat-eating is the ethically worse option. Meat-eating is unhealthier, it hurts the environment and it leads to all that disgusting, sadistic shit that we put animals through. And, let's be honest... at this point, we're all aware of that fact. The evidence is so overwhelming that anyone who denies veganism is better is just doing some premium coping, and it's honestly so pathetic.\n\nIf you want to eat meat, feel free. People make bad choices all the time, that's human nature. I don't particularly care either way. It's the weakness I see in a lot of meat-eaters that annoys me. The inability to just be strong and stand by the choices you make, rather than having to lie and pretend you're not picking the worse option. It's like a smoker trying to still argue \"Smoking actually helps, look at this study from the 1860s!\" Honestly, it's embarrassing.\n\nOh, and not that it's relevant to the opinion, but I'm not a vegan. Meat is absolutely delicious, especially in a nice BBQ. I'm about to eat some pulled pork in a sandwich right now. I recognize veganism as the better option, but so is not smoking when I drink, and I don't do that either.

They think that making a offensive joke on a public forum, like twitter, can\n\n 1: turn people into believing nazism or racist ideologies\n\n 2: makes nazis or racists feel safe\n\n3: can offend random people scrolling\n\nMaking an offensive joke around friends is fine. No one wants to cancel that. Making a jew joke around friends ain't gonna turn them into nazis, or make them feel safe to be a nazi because they aren't nazis.

Today we have the United Nations, and although today it doesn\u2019t really do much besides some aid work, the foundation for a one world government is already here.\n\n\nIf you think that it\u2019s impossible because the world is too divided, look at the European Union. 80 years ago Europe was still a war zone, with all the little countries fighting for dominance. Today, all of Western Europe essentially functions as one nation, to great benefit of its members. Yeah, the UK left, and it\u2019s been a disaster.

Racism is seen as wrong and immoral... but discrimination based on nationality is common place. Almost everyone seems to agree it's fine.\n\nPretty simply, the reason racism is bad is because you're discriminating against someone for a characteristic of their birth that they did not choose and that has no effect on their character. Another characteristic that fits that exact same field? Nationality.\n\nPeople would have an outcry if a patient was denied service because he was white or black, but the notion that illegal immigrants not only don't deserve healthcare, but should have their kids taken away and be kicked out of the country is commonplace. There's a debate over how inhumane the discrimination should be, but near everyone agrees it's justified.\n\nI see people get offended by this opinion, and it's certainly very unpopular.

I believe the exact opposite. The strong, smart, brave, and competent have a duty to help those less fortunate than themselves. Putting them under pressure rarely works as a way to help such people stand on their own feet, notwithstanding inspirational motivation stories. In fact, it's more likely to make them less effectual, due to raising the price for so-called self-improvement (I say so-called because my idea of self-improvement is moral and ethical, of which money, power, sex appeal, popularity, glory-getting, community status and prestige is no substitute). With that said, I'll go on to my reasons I don't take either those phrases seriously, and even say that victim-blaming is immoral in and of itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-  Confuses *inability* to stop or reverse a bad thing with *willfully allowing* a bad thing happen (\"letting\", a usual synonym for allowing, is also victim-blaming)\n\n\\- Fails to see that sometimes lack of bad intent *does* excuse undesirable outcomes, even if other times it's no \"Get Out Of Jail Free\" card.\n\n\\- Shifts responsibility on people least able to handle the difficulty,  thereby putting an unreasonable burden on the person (How can you be responsible for something if you're unable to deal with it?)\n\n\\- Sees responsibility itself more in terms of *favorable results*, rather than taking an unsuccessful action against the bad thing.\n\n\\- Ignores the unique details of the person's life experience that caused him or her to take either no or insufficient action to stop the bad thing, This includes repeated experiences of even worse treatment or scorn for actually trying and failing than if they didn't try at all (which, let's face it, is not exactly a rare reaction from onlookers).\n\n\\-Shoehorns the average person's abilities and talents into the victim, thus making a false comparison.\n\n\\- Irrationally shames victimhood itself when the victim clearly lacked intent to do a bad thing to anyone. This implies the blamer has either crude understandings of free will or vastly underestimates either (a) the bad consequences of a failed effort to stop a bad thing\n\nAnd these are why I find \"Toughen Up!\", \"Don't be stupid!\" as supposed motivators or otherwise \"cures\" for another person's shortcommings a joke.

I understand the two-party system and to be honest, both sides have policies that differ in certain aspects.\n\nAnd my whole thesis is basically because we are so individualized in every way, we have a lot of ideas at our disposal, but with two sides, we don't utilize every idea, if both ideas from both sides are trash, why can't we make another one? It's the same us-them mentality that drives it, eliminating independent thought and ideas.\n\nThere are no sides. And judging from the state of human rights in America, the real enemies are the ones taking any humans rights away regardless of gender, sex, race, ethnic, etc. There are claims that human rights are being stripped thanks to Republican Party. They are not one sided, I\u2019ve seen both sides limit and take away human rights on both ends of the spectrum. And before you piss your pants and say this is centrist talk, yeah fucking right, \u201ccentrism\u201d is a dumb buzzword to eliminate the idea of independent political thinkers who have solutions that are wildly different from both sides.\n\nAlso the amount of hypocrisy, GOOD GOD, it\u2019s even MORE proof we run on party over country. Most of these \"sides\" only care about these issues if it benefits their party, cases in point:\n\nThose free speech warriors; Like banning TikTok over no proof and all misinformation all because its user base criticized the right and those warriors tried to slander the company then promote GETTR who actively censors the left ([including this group who debunks the TikTok misinfomation](https:\/\/gettr.com\/post\/p2evef)).\n\nThose Blue Lives Matter who stormed the capitol gunning down the police that they themselves \u201clove so much\u201d. Holy fuck, even the police killed one and these people made that person the hero while pissing over George Floyd to shill police love when they also shill the \u201chero\u201d who got gunned down by police. I think her name was... Ashli Babbitt?\n\nAnd these two are just the beginning!\n\nHell I don\u2019t think they gave a shit about China or Russia or now with Afghanistan and the Taliban, they just use it as a buzzword for validation but do NOTHING to solve the issue. For instance: As much as everyone on Reddit \u201chates\u201d China, THE SIDES HAVEN\u2019T DONE SHIT. Why don\u2019t they just make a change by protesting over there and promote country over party by realizing that party\u2019s do jack and making the US known there?\n\nYep I said it, those are keyboard warriors. I guess all these party\u2019s can do is comment China and Russia Bad and be all talk and no bite. Pussies is the better term.\n\nYes. Them bad. But are they doing something about it besides posting a comment on reddit for feeling validation? No. Posting it to promote your party by being a slacktivist? Yes. The sides care about their issues if it benefits them, and not everyone. They care about themselves. That's what these sides do! It's a ploy to destroy civil discourse and democracy!\n\nYes, it is all that it is, performative slacktivism! They NEVER gave a FUCK about any issue, they just promote it and IGNORE it to promote your PARTY. Hell even then, these guys will spew misinformation no matter the side to promote your ideology.\n\nThey care about CLOUT and CLOUT alone to fuel the division instead of CHANGE.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nI understand we have a lot of questions about the law, but FUCK we have a lot of case laws set in place that they ignore under the guise of \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cpropaganda\u201d. Critical thinking and research is dead, these \"sides\" want to be reinforced. And that\u2019s the worst part, each sides ideology has multiple influences for both parties and you have to pick the side who has the most ideologies that you want to see change. It\u2019s lesser of the two evils and it promotes THIS. This toxic team battle that ends up killing rational, civil, and respectful discussion that you fuckers, no matter the side, think it\u2019s for the fucking \u201cgreater good\u201d.\n\nThere is no LEFT and there is no RIGHT.

Obesity is a serious problem in the First World, and it's something we're going to need to deal with. I'm not saying that we should treat obesity as a positive, nor should we encourage it. \n\nHowever, we need to teach fat people to love themselves, and their bodies, so that they can improve upon them. After all, one can love something while acknowledging it has faults, and if anything, loving something is going to make you much more likely to dedicate the effort to fix those faults.\n\nWe can see that with how damaging the inverse, fat shaming, is. It's been proven time after time to be ineffective, because shame makes people eat.

Anyone who suggests this as a solution is either just really stupid, or doesn't care about actually helping and just wants to try make themselves feel better for their own weaknesses.\n\nThe solution isn't to make fat people hate their bodies. We need to teach fat people to love their bodies. Not to think their bodies are perfect, mind you, but to see that their bodies are something worthy of love and something that should be improved upon. People need to be pushed towards change in a positive way that doesn't just make them feel like crap and eat more.\n\nThis is far from the only problem, of course. There's a lot of other factors in play here, like how fatty foods are often cheaper, how corporations can obscure what is and isn't healthy and, of course, people just being stupid and not taking into account how they're destroying their bodies.\n\nBut the evidence is in.

Even if he doesn\u2019t die but gets a long lasting covid side effect, that would be crushing. \n\nNot to mention, unvaccinated people are helping create new variants which can be more transmittable, more deadly, or more resistant to the vaccine. \n\nYou have freedom in America, but with every freedom comes responsibility.\n\nEdit: this is definitely unpopular especially in this sub based on the responses","1878":"[removed]","1879":"I'm not a financial genius or anything but I'd bet if you threw your money into an index fund while you're young like the SP500 and leave it alone for a couple decades, history has shown you'll end up richer than you were from when you started.  Yes this is called an investment.  It's so easy you could get a monkey to throw darts to pick a bunch of stocks and make money off it after a couple decades.  People who hate Wall Street hate it because they aren't using it to make money, or have bet on speculative yolo stock gambles. Because Wall Street can make money for everybody. The rich and poor and in-between.","1880":"[removed]"},"comments":{"0":"<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776D933C18>","1":"<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object
