1,rsjrsg,Student debt forgiveness is a Racist policy that will only hurt minorities.,KindnessSuplexDaddy,1640919800.0,5,0.55,36,"Minorities will be left behind. Take Black Americans. They are per captia least likely to attend  or graduate college. That means a small percentage of a minority group graduate college.


Source: https://www.americanprogress.org/article/neglected-college-race-gap-racial-disparities-among-college-completers/

Student debt forgiveness will effect all the Minorities who DID NOT attend college. Everyone who has a college degree compared to a non college degree holder already has a life time earning advantage over the major of non college educated Minorities. White people graduate at the highest percentage and have the best lifetime earnings advantage.

https://edtrust.org/resource/graduation-rates-dont-tell-the-full-story-racial-gaps-in-college-success-are-larger-than-we-think/



Erasing that debt, is for all intents giving them on average 30k or +300.00 a month in income AND lifetime income. That sudden injection of income will allow college graduates to buy houses, invest into retirement and if done well, that 30k can be extrapolated into hundreds of thousands of dollars for retirement.

All those things, non college graduates, Minorities like Black and Mexican Americans will be behind by 30k or 300 a month. Up to 70%.

Those Minorities won't have the ability to accumulate intrest/invest money like that into retirement. 

Minorities who won't get anything will not have anything to pass on compared to those who got student loans forgiven.


Student loans will only hurt minorities in America. It will increase the wealth gap, quality of life and generational wealth between whites and minorities.  A massive wealth shift like never before in history of America. I checked. 

We should never support something that makes us rich at the cost of others.  

The answer to your financial problems does not come at the cost of future generations.

I know I’m gonna get downvoted into oblivion here but please try to keep an open mind.

The vulva has around 15,000 nerves, 8000 of which are in the clitoris. The male groin has around 4,000 nerve endings. 

The vulva is basically an open wound that can’t move or retract so it takes the full impact of the kick/hit.

But the vulva is slightly harder to hit due to the fact that it’s flat and a bit smaller

11,rrg71a,the star wars fandom is one of the most toxic fandoms of all time,herequeerandgreat,1640805644.0,1,0.53,6," let me preface this by saying that i like star wars alot. i like the original trilogy, the sequel trilogy, rogue one, and the Mandalorian. although i do consider myself more of a star trek fan then a star wars fan, i love star wars for it\`s creativity, cast of characters, interesting world building, and amazing music.

that being said, whenever i think of things that have super toxic fandoms, i instantly think of the star wars fandom. i think fandoms are a good thing(i\`m a part of a couple so it would be hypocritical of me to say that i don\`t like them lol). however, some things have really toxic fandoms and star wars has one of the most toxic fanbases if not THE most toxic(and i\`m in the my little pony fandom so i know what i\`m talking about).

firstly, the star wars fandom is extremely hard to please if not downright impossible to please. when the force awakens came out, it was criticized for being too much like a new hope. then, the last jedi(which is in the top 5 of my favorite star wars movies) came out and fans were criticizing it for being too different from the other movies. what? it seems like the only thing star wars fans can agree on is that the original trilogy is good and the Mandalorian is Steller television.

this wouldn\`t be such a huge problem if the fandom wasn\`t so mean towards outside opinions. if you dare to say that you liked the sequel trilogy, prepare to be on the receiving end of many insults questioning your taste in movies and even some personal attacks that are completely uncalled for. ditto if you dare to say anything bad about the prequels(which i guess we all like now).

lastly, the star wars fandom has been at the center of most fan entitlement in the past couple of years. when the fans get pissed at something star wars related, THEY FUCKING LOSE IT! some have even gone to the extent of sending threats to some of the people involved in star wars. dude! it\`s a movie! just give it a negative review on IMDB on move on with your life.

star wars is my go to example of something that i like but hate the fanbase of. i know that every fandom has some bad eggs. i also know that not all star wars fans are like that. one of my managers is an uber star wars fan(like, collecting toys from the 80s. that\`s the type of fan we\`re dealing with here) and he\`s one of the nicest people i know and is not at all a douche about contradictory opinions. however, it honestly seems like the star wars fandom is just full of bad eggs and it seems like the nice star wars fans who just want to enjoy something that they love have become the exception instead of the norm.

it\`s perfectly alright to be passionate about something(i have quite a few pieces of media that i passionately love myself) but just chill the hell out folks.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770A3A6DA0>

16,rqob00,I think Yahweh would praise intactivists(anti-circumcision) and circumsexuals(pro-circumcision) before praising anyone devotedly Jewish but doing a disservice to Jewish history by denying the Jewish origin and purpose of circumcision.,WhereIsHisRidgedBand,1640721794.0,6,0.64,49,"To elaborate, r/intactivists are activists who believe that circumcision causes damage to the sexual organ and renders it permanently inhibited in some way. NSFW r/circumsexual are self-proclaimed individuals with an ""erotic"" mind toward circumcision. NSFL [Some of them like the damages](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrossCutters/comments/nzc6nr/gross_cutter_feels_pleasure_when_boys_are/).

Both sides confirm the teachings of Jewish leaders about circumcision's origin and purpose:

>Contrary to the Greeks and Romans, who believed in keeping the glans covered to show sexual control, Philo argued that removing the foreskin was what allowed Jewish men even greater control over their sexual passions. But why circumcise only males? In a volume entitled Questions and Answers on Genesis, Philo’s answer is that

>‘‘the male has more pleasure in, and desire for, mating than does the female, and he is more ready for it. Therefore Herightly leaves out the female, and **suppresses the undue impulses of the male by the sign of circumcision. [So] it was proper that his pride should be checked by the sign of circumcision**.’’

>[Philo, Questions and Answers 3.47, 241–42.] https://archive.ph/FfkYQ#selection-1955.0-1975.15


>Part III, Chapter 49

>Similarly with regard to circumcision, one of the reasons for is activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible. It has been thought that circumcision perfects what is defective congenitally. This gave the possibility to everyone to raise an objection and to say: How can natural things be defective so that they need to be perfected from outside, all the more because we know how useful the foreskin is for that member? **In fact this commandment has not been prescribed with a view to perfecting what is defective congenitally, but to perfecting what is defective morally. The bodily pain caused to that member is the real purpose of circumcision.** None of the activities necessary for the preservation of the individual is harmed thereby, nor is procreation rendered impossible, but violent concupiscence and lust that goes beyond what is needed are diminished. **The fact that circumcision weakens the faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes the pleasure is indubitable. For if at birth this member has been made to bleed and has had its covering taken away from it, it must indubitably be weakened. The Sages, may their memory be blessed, have explicitly stated: It is hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him. In my opinion this is the strongest of the reasons for circumcision.**

>Moses Maimonides http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/maimonides/

I'm guessing these two know a lot more about keeping up with true Jewish traditions than someone today who is Jewish and saying things about circumcision along the lines of:

>Circumcision is not comparable to FGM in any way shape or form. There is almost nothing done to the man's sexuality or his orgasms. Women lose everything. Men can still orgasm, and good ones.

Then that man has narrowly escaped what these two Jewish leaders wanted the circumcision done for and what these men got r/circumcisiongrief

>You may not like religion or hold it in high regard, but it is their right to do so and practice as they see fit, whether or not you approve. One of their practices, which to be clear, is NOT a human rights violation by any standard, is circumcision.

I know China gets a lot of flak for their binding feet, and European corsets were damaging women's organs, but at least both of them should be able to conclude in the future that what Philo and Moses are saying above are a human rights violation if conducted on days old infant human beings at the weakest and least mentally developed point of their lives.

So, I believe if Yahweh was real and wanted circumcision for the purpose laid out by these two famous followers of his and highly regarded leaders of Jewish teachings, then circumcised intactivists and circumsexuals will get to heaven before anyone devotedly Jewish but blaspheming his covenant's cost.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017709E30908>

22,rpz4q0,Right wing libertarianism makes the least sense,CheckYourCorners,1640644013.0,15,0.64,144,"Let me be clear, libertarianism and maximizing freedom are some of the most important goals to have. Right wing libertarianism does not accomplish either of these goals. 

It has a great concept of negative freedoms (lack of external restraint on one's actions) but completely ignored positive freedoms (the capacity to act on ones free will). Workers in a company town technically have the freedom to leave and make money elsewhere but lack the money and capacity to do so.

Capitalism left to it's own devices always degrades into monopoly. The easiest examples to point to are any industry that commands a natural monopoly, in which the cost of entry is so high competition is nonexistent. Water, electricity, internet, social media, and infrastructure in general are all monopolies that are near impossible to break. Neoliberals realized this quite early and created their philosophy. They believe free markets require a strong state to maintain and the spread of neoliberalism has been nearly unstoppable ever since.

Not to mention they can be extremely comedic in their attempts to create right wing libertarian societies. The various attempts to create seafaring utopias have all failed spectacularly. One had a large security force that enforced the rules of the shareholders. Another banned cooking in individual suites and required people to buy from the ships restaurant. 

Freedom was never the goal, anybody who believes in this ideology either wants to smoke weed and own guns (just switch to left wing libertarianism if you want that) or believes that they would become the defacto monarch of this theoretical society.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017702E73F28>

Loud noises simply make me uncomfortable,so when the teachers shut them up,I become calmer (I need an *extremely* quiet environment to do my work efficiently).


Tldr:You can joke around about how teachers getting mad over someone chewing gum is stupid and all,but don't try to keep a straight face while saying that loud chewing doesn't annoy you,especially if it involves someone on the spectrum who simply can't help but be irritated by that type of behavior.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001770A039A20>

Then she worked for literally 18 (or more) years to raise you for no pay. NO PAY. She actually had to pay to 100,000 dollars a year to raise you. Like I know fathers do work too but, the bar is literally in hell for them. Plus they don’t have to push it out.

Update: I typed this post while I was drinking and literally not giving a second thought as to what I was saying other than making it as unpopular as possible. If you were to not regard any other aspect of parenthood in any other way then labor and value exchange then the statement is true. I know that isn’t all because, biology plays a role in it too, as well as other social and psychological factors. 

As It still stands, there is a significant economic disadvantage that comes with being a mother in this day and age. So, I think single parents and mothers should get paid and evaluated like any other job in society. It’ll make it easier to raise a child if the parent doesn’t also have to worry about working 2 jobs to put food on the table.

The work is hard, there are skills required. You cook food, clean up a kitchen, and deal with whiny people all day (the hardest part.)

There are roofers, warehouse workers, people in industrial plants - do they make $20 an hour? Entry? No? They should. Even after years many of them barely break $20 here in Ohio, and they break their bodies for the work they do. They should get more. And so should fast food workers.

It doesn't matter if any of these workers would quit their job to work at McDonald's for $20 an hour. They're all labor intensive in their own way, just like roofers, warehouse workers, people in industrial plants aren't directly equivocal.

Workers deserve more money, 100%. Not just one sector, not just one employer. Raise the minimum wage, make wages competitive. Right now, arguably, seems to be one of the best times to be a worker with all the competition to get new hires. Well, if it weren't for the pandemic, of course.

I’ve seen the debate and people like to believe they have it figured out. There’s 3 main factors people always bring up. Age, Maturity, Appearance.

Statistically we can say there’s some correlation between these things but using stats for each individual situation is facetious. There are many more factors to consider within each situation since these factors aren’t directly contingent on each other. We also can only see relationships from our perspective and not from the perspective of people in the relationship.

So my view is that when it comes to age gap relationships, as long as it’s legal, we should live and let live. Trying to create a universal truth about what is right will always be contradictory and prejudice against someone.

It has failed to hear that the economic plight of the  Negro poor has worsened over the last few years.”

“But  it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots.  It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same  time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in  our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to  feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent  rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the  language of the unheard. And what is it America has failed to hear?… It  has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not  been met.

I can talk about my stances without needing to say I'm right wing. Because saying I'm right wing doesn't explain my views. I can't explain my views with just 'I'm a conservative'

Before you jump in because you have a political science degree, its possible that in academia these words are well defined. However, I think we should purge it from colloquial terms. No one has been able to give a definition of liberal that everyone or at least 95% can agree on. 

also, to assume one is say, a liberal because they believe in x, and therefore because they are a liberal they believe in y is stupid. I admit there is a correlation with x and y, but to make it definite is the problem.

You can argue my views on sexuality is on the left, whatever that means, and my views about refugees are on the right, and while that might be useful, the problem is we focus on the person. If one has a left leaning view then a right leaning view, do they cancel out?

How the modern white-woke Conservative uses ""Division"", is similar to people who say ""we need to have an honest conversation about race"". They don't want an honest conversation, they simply want you to capitulate to all of their talking points. What the white-wokes actually mean by ""Division"" is : ""you're trying to stop me from being racist, in turn, taking away all of my unearned white privileges. We as racists love our privilege and don't want that to change, therefore, you are necessarily wrong "". That's all it is, man. It really is that simple and is the foundation from which the white-woke Marxists operate. 


Nah, we've always been divided. Back then it was by force, today it is by choice. Jim Crow, Segregation, etc, was only possible because it's what white people wanted, which is why the same behavior is seen today, despite overturning forced segregation.

All of the legislation that is censoring what teachers can talk about and what books can be available in schools is coming from the anti-CRT crowd.,Electrical-Ad-9797,1639883299.0,4,0.57,72,"These kinds of arguments have been made over and over to fuel the panic surrounding CRT but I challenge anyone to find a piece of legislation or proposed legislation to censor dissenting perspectives coming from the CRT side.  Getting “cancelled” on Twitter or private social media companies deciding what to allow is in no way comparable to actual laws that limit what teachers can and can’t talk about.  The “stop woke” bill in Florida is effectively no different from the Ministry of Truth in 1984.  The accusation is constantly thrown around that proponents of CRT try to silence their critics by calling them racists.  However I only see the opposite happening.  Multiple states are passing laws outlawing the teaching of any material related to CRT based on the accusation that it is “anti white racism”.  However that accusation is not fact but opinion.  Certainly it is the opinion of the Harvard School of Law where CRT was developed that it is not anti white racism but rather a critical analysis of the ways systemic racism is perpetuated and interacts with the law.  If the anti-CRT side feels so confident that their views concerning systemic racism are correct than why are they making opposing viewpoints illegal?  That makes it look like they know they are wrong and are threatened by the truth.  The whole point of education is to be exposed to diverse perspectives and form your own opinion using critical analysis.  I read “The Communist Manifesto” in high school history, that doesn’t mean I was being indoctrinated into Communism.  How can you expect students to be able to do this if you are outlawing and censoring all materials from perspectives you don’t agree with?

81,rjb1n6,"Samsung sucks compared to Motorola, and I'm probably never going back to Samsung, Ever, due to no 3.5mm jack and Ads in stock apps.",D4NC3M461CD4NC3,1639845174.0,8,0.67,6,"So, recently I got a new phone. I was skeptical as it wasn't a big name flagship in the phone industry, but it has the features I was looking for. One of these is a 3.5mm headphone jack. I believe wired headphones or earbuds are far superior and safer than anything exclusively wireless or Bluetooth. That's just my opinion, consistent with my functional usage needs. 

The type of phone doesn't matter as much as the elements of it that I use and need such as the headphone jack and the fact that it is customizable, but I'll say it anyway. It's a Moto Stylus 5G 2021. For example, it does not have ads in native apps such as the music app like Samsung started doing. 

This phone did not even come with a native Gallery app so I was able to choose whatever app I decided. Some people would say that is left of a feature and more of a nuisance, but I disagree. I am all about user customization and more particularly, user freedom.

I feel it's unfair to compare my previous Samsung with this phone's features much further in this post as the earlier Samsung was supposedly factory unlocked but it was still Samsung which means the firmware and stock apps were had Samsung's wet blanket of control over them, while this new phone is a carrier phone. So, apples to oranges in those areas which I'll avoid when possible.

For me, ditching Samsung for the less ""popular"" brand Motorola has been the right decision due to my disagreement with Samsung's decisions.
These decisions are:

- To be a follower (of Apple who removed their 3.5mm first) instead of a leader in the industry.

- Dictating heavy-handed decisions regarding users' needs and requests en masse (Ok Google, remember dark/black theme user requests in Android for YEARS?)

- Ethical questions regarding ads in stock aps (particularly the music app) - or, more
 specifically, any kind of subscription-based business model that is unnecessary and therefore greedy.

It seems all these decisions are faced companies which gain any type of industry domination (Looking at you, gaming companies) companies fail to recognize the ones who made them great in the first place - their customers.

I came across an article saying Samsung is going to stop putting ads in their stock apps. Great, but for me, it is too little too late as I have already moved on to a better company's product for good. Just because a big name is hugely popular does not mean the company makes the right decision for all users.

Also, I never noticed a premium ""flagship"" phone ""feature"" that didn't seem like a gimmick or unnecessary waste of money or time that actually enhanced the official day to day use of my phone. Curved screen and wireless charging to me, were more of a hassle or liability than they were worth.

now, onto the subject at hand.

what many people don\`t know is that bill maher actually has a cameo in an MCU movie. in iron man 3. it\`s understandable if you don\`t remember the details of iron man 3 since it and thor the dark world are often considered to be the black sheeps of the marvel cinematic universe. but, bill maher has a cameo as himself making jokes about the iron patriot. as such, since he has actually appeared in the MCU, this makes his statements sting even more infuriating. it\`s reminiscing of when katherine heigl accused knocked up(a movie SHE starred in) of being sexist.

is bill maher entitled to his opinion? sure. he could have been less douchy about it but sure. however, it is MY opinion that he should not be allowed to disrespect stan lee, the MCU, and it\`s fans while also picking up a check every time an MCU movie is played on television, bought on dvd, or streamed. there has been a lot of talk recently of removing donald trump\`s cameo from home alone 2. well, here\`s an idea. let\`s remove bill maher\`s cameo from iron man 3.

i mean, it\`s a very brief cameo so none of the plot will be lost. it could just be replaced with something else or it could be removed completely. 

you may think that this is an overreaction. however, it\`s no different then other employers. if a teacher criticizes the school district they work in, they are entitled to their opinion and can\`t face any legal action, which they shouldn\`t. however, the school district is well within their right to fire that teacher. same thing with employees from other branches of business. if you were running a restaurant, would you want to employ someone who openly dissed your restaurant. think about that.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177110FE780>

Many of these people will adopt the image of a criminal and use it as some kind of positive thing as well. And, if by chance some of these people have criminal records, instead of looking at it as a shameful blot in their past, they look at it as something that validates their image.

That is why I feel like hip-hop and rap culture has really done some damage to a lot of people, usually starting in their pre-teen years.

I believe western culture would be in a slightly better place if we didn’t glorify rappers so much and if rappers didn’t glorify gang culture and criminality like they do now",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177111422B0>

In my opinion, this should be considered cancel culture.

People on the right tend to call left wing boycotts, people being critical of a comedian and complaining about that comedian allegedly being transphobic or bigoted in another way, a movie or TV franchise changing something to be more progressive, a social media company banning a conservative for violating TOS(even though leftists get banned for violating TOS all the time) and private companies and corporations changing certain things about their brand cancel culture.

That being said, they should had known better. Anyone who uploads reactions and heavy reviews needs to be aware of the rules regarding it. And it feels like they just weren't. Despite ""great effort"" to follow the copyright rules, it seems like they didn't research at all.

1) copyright laws aren't internacional. Each country has their own rules. If you want to upload japanese content, you should be aware of japanese law. It's pretty arrogant to act like western law is universal. 

2) it's pretty unbeliavable that someone who has been making anime videos for so many years with a team simply doesn't know about the ways to be safer. They could restrict the videos in Japan, as many people do. It's pretty pathetic to be mad you are having problems doing that AFTER the claims. You should had done it years ago. You could also had contacted Toei and tried making a deal (like, a share of revenue). Both of those actions would make things a lot better

3) you can feel that the whole case is based on emotion. There is no legal ground here. Using phrases like "" life destroying"" or ""stealing my work""...

4) boycotting Toei himself is okay, absolutely. Asking for people to boycott them too is a little too far. Directly telling Toei, with japanese translation, that if they don't step back millions of people will boycott them... It's too much. It was disrespectful to use his subscribers like that. He should had gone with ""I am willing to discuss it with you directly and so we can make a deal"". You need to make concessions .

Essentially saying ""don't rape"" is the same as saying ""don't murder""; none of them will stop rape and murder respectively. Why? Precisely because rapists and murderers are immoral people who do NOT care about morality, law and humanity.

Therefore, my solution is simple. Legalise STATE CONTROLLED prostitution. No, not that cliche prostitution, but a kind of prostitution wherein women (and/or men) work by their own wish, and are supported by the nation. These sex workers would regularly undergo HIV/AIDS testing, the way pornstars do. The state control would mean that prostitution would be non-profit (only the sex workers would get 100% of the income) and that there would be no chance of extortion or human trafficking.

This would solve one of the greatest societal problems today. Sexually frustrated men and women could seek out sexual satisfaction in a safe controlled manner.

Picture this. 

You are a brand new, adult human released into the wild. How do you survive? You must gather resources by foraging or trading with other humans to get your food, water and shelter from the elements. Nature does not just give them to you, effort must be spent to obtain them. 

Expand this into the modern day. Most land/resources are owned by others, so in order to obtain the necessary resources to survive one must trade with others. What resource do you have to trade? Your labor. You must trade your time/effort to someone else for the resources needed to survival, again nature doesn't strictly hand them to you. 

What determines how much someone gives you for your labor? They answer is how much value they believe that you add to them. Therefore, how useful you are to another is directly proportional to the amount you paid for your work. 

'Woah man, not everything is strictly about economic transactions. Sometimes you add value to someone's life just by being there for them'

You know what? This is 100% true. But, it's not by your inherent value that they care about it, it's based on the time and effort you've put towards getting to know each other. Additionally, the caliber of each person will vary on how much this relationship pans out. For instance, you could be friends, close friends, with someone for decades, but they wouldn't let you sleep on their couch if you were suddenly homeless whereas other people would let you do it after only knowing you for a week or two. 

The next thing someone might ask is 'well what about children'? Well I ask you, do you really care about children starving in the world or are you just too empathic to look a child directly in front of you, in the eye, begging for food 'no'? I would bet it is the latter and not the former because how many of you are donating money/effort in ending hunger around the world right now? 

All human interactions have the following thought, whether it is direct/overt or subconscious: how does this action benefit me? Is this worth it? Will this person pay me back either monetarily or benefiting some other way from our relationship (such as not feeling lonely, receiving love, affection, gifts etc)?

We almost got evicted because we almost couldn't pay the bills. But now we are ok. I still hold the 'eat the rich' mentalities is dumb. I am now a lower middle class, I am richer than I was before, but I am still nowhere 'rich'. I got like, maybe 50$ left over after everything every month? I have a 15$ netflix.

Yes, someone will say this is the 'slippery slope fallacy', but it's not. Please tell me what line do you draw before the rich shouldn't have their money? It's nonsense. I don't think the 'rich people must give their money away' is good economics.

Until you are willing to give up all your luxuries, I don't think you should lecture others on giving up theirs. Tell me your line and why.

However IMO anything futher or other than that should be treated as a crime. Robbery is just inexcusable. No hardship can justify you threatening or hurting (often with a deadly weapon at hand) someone over their rightful belongings. And I see no justification for stealing from others beyond the cases I mentioned before.

Common counter-arguments I hear (speacially on Reddit) it's that: It's acceptable to steal from the rich, It´s ok to steal from Corporations and It's ok to steal insured property. All, IMO, are BS:

\- It's acceptable to steal from the rich: The rich are just as entitled to the protection of the law as you are. The victim being rich and the criminal being poor should mean nothing. Would it be ok to a poor man r\*pe a rich woman, or poor mass-murderer to shoot up a place full rich people ? Most reasonable people would say ***no***.

\-it´s ok to steal from Corporations: Same as the first. It's okay to blow up an Amazon facility or set a KFC ablaze because they are Big Money ? Besides, if you rob an amazon warehouse, you will not be pointing your gun at Jeff Bezos, you will be doing that to a minimum-wage bathroom-less employee. And that's not getting into the macro-effects of widespread stealing from business, such as they pulling out operations.

\-It's ok to steal insured property: Even if we assume all stolen property are insured, which is simply not true, you would still be severely inconveniencing someone else.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177115AD550>

Take Irish-Americans, for example. We've got our own history of our ancestors coming over from the famine in Ireland to climb out of poverty in the face of anti-Catholic discrimination.

We've got our own heroes, like the Irish Brigade of the Civil War. We have our own movies like ""Gangs of New York"" or ""Boondock Saints"". We have our own music, like the Dropkick Murphys. 

Are all these things American? Yes, absolutely. But in the same way that nobody would question that something like ""The Boondocks"" is both fully American and distinctly African-American, one should be able to understand the same of Irish-Americans. And it's the same with Italian-Americans, Greek-Americans, or what have you. 

Why is this something important to Americans? Because we all grow up learning about how our ancestors came from somewhere else. Whereas people in other (non-former colonial) countries can figure their ancestors probably lived in the same general area for centuries, Americans know their ancestors have only been American for max a few centuries - and in many cases not that much. So, we Americans naturally want to know which story our ancestors come from. It's melting pot culture. 

It's important, too. Historically, much of the absolute worst of racism has come from groups who try to assert themselves as ""true Americans"". That's where you get shameful histories like the KKK of the 1920's. It's telling that today's KKK portrays ""whites"" as true Americans. The concept of race is a completely artificial way of grouping people with little to nothing in common past their skin tone, but it's used to justify hate. 

Reminding people of their immigrant roots encourages them to distance themselves from identifying themselves as ""true, white Americans"" and excluding immigrants. That's probably why (anecdotally) I've noted that first generation immigrants seem to be the most enthusiastic about identifying other Americans with their ancestry. It makes sense.  It makes them feel less out of place.

Tl;dr every American traces back from an immigrant group and identifying with that group is both justified and and an important part of being American.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177115E4470>

I'm a guy, but the more female friends I make the more I realise this. Women watch porn, most of my female friends do and having a whole gay side but only categories for lesbians seems kinda stupid, you know?

Before you bite me, another reason is bc I feel like having a lesbian side would make it easier for people who wanna jerk off to it to access a bigger variety, and lesbians/mspec women get better have access to lesbian porn, too. Boom, everyone's happy. You have way more access to kinkier shit and tons of new categories and women get to see women screw other women easier so basically it's a win win.

Women using sex toys should also be there if a guy solo jerking off is considered gay. Which by the way it shouldn't sometimes people like the company, another hill I will proudly die on

Don't really know what I'm on about but I'm 100% sure I'm correct. Nobody can change my mind.

There should either be no gay side, or a lesbian side for women who want to get off to women and men who want to get off to women. It's unfair that there isn't, and we all know girls like porn too. Why is it different for women? Even porn hub acknowledges that women watch porn with that category of videos women favour. Being a woman is also an option when you make an account.

I will die on this hill. Make a lesbian side/add it to the gay side or merge the gay side and the straight side. It's only fair

1-Atheism in reddit is so toxic to a level you can't imagine, there was a video of a guy who was holding a goat that was screaming out of nowhere and people started calling him slurs in the comments and bring islam into the equation somehow.

2- Reddit is full of wanna be intellectuals that are into the reddit hivemind , they downvote whenever they see a different opinion. It's basically that all opinions are welcome except the ones they don't agree with.


3- power tripping isn't uncommon among reddit mods, they can ban you for anything that other people do just because it breaks the rule 175 that they recently added. In reality, they don't have anything against you but they just ban you because of different opinions.

4- It's full of creeps, a lot of people here claim to love women and fight for their rights but then they go send  creepy messages to women. Not to mention the teenager sub, no one can comment or post there without having neckbeards in their dms.

5- You can't search anything on reddit without seeing anything NSFW even if you turn off the NSFW, that's because a lot of the porn isn't labeled as NSFW.

6- Subreddits like ahs and female dating strategy are there and they want to ban everyone but they have no chance of getting banned themselves.

7- A lot of redditors are obsessed with religious women in a very creepy and perverted way, they consider them oppressed if they don't want to show their bodies. Just post a photo from the 60s or 70s from a muslim country and this is the easy way to get karma, they don't mind that most women there were illiterate at the time. All they mind is them wearing miniskirts.

8- There are multiple subreddits which contain photoshopped photos of women on nudes, the women don't even know that someone did that to their photos.

There are more reasons than this but these are just the top ones.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001771129D588>

The reality is that Reddit isn't fundamentally different from any other social media platform. There's a ton of good content and interesting discussions here. There's also a ton of vapid, meaningless, and evil shit.

TikTok is exactly the same. Like any gathering of millions of different people, there's going to be good content and there's going to be bad content. 

Honestly, the algorithm has done a pretty good job of giving me a positive experience. My TikTok is full of musicians, history facts, philosophy, comedy, mental health advocacy (real advocacy, not self-diagnosing BS), and more.

3. The patriot act.
4. Extreme penalties for certain minor crimes, like basically destroying someone's life if they have a BAC of .081% when pulled over. That should be ""pull over, wait 45 minutes and pay a 300 dollar petty misdemeanor akin to speeding.""

Like, I'm so pro 2A that I'm I think it should be legal to sell stinger missiles in vending machines and tanks at the car dealership. For me, 2A stops at nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and bioweapons, i.e. shit that's illegal for our own military. But I don't honestly find the vaccine mandate to be a big deal in the slightest, and in fact, I think a vaccine mandate is one of the few basic functions of a small government.

Like, if a government can't mandate vaccines, how the fuck do we deal with something like smallpox? Let Facebook health-gurus convince people to not get the smallpox vaccine, killing millions now and millions in the future as it continues to spread and mutate?

Our PLANET doesn’t need saving. WE do. The people who spread these slogans are just self righteous, sad people.

**Quoting George Carlin:**

**“** We’re so self-important. Everybody’s going to save something now. “Save the trees, save the bees, save the whales, save those snails.” And the greatest arrogance of all: save the planet. Save the planet, we don’t even know how to take care of ourselves yet. I’m tired of this shit. I’m tired of f-ing Earth Day. I’m tired of these self-righteous environmentalists, these white, bourgeois liberals who think the only thing wrong with this country is that there aren’t enough bicycle paths. People trying to make the world safe for Volvos. Besides, environmentalists don’t give a shit about the planet. Not in the abstract they don’t. You know what they’re interested in? A clean place to live. Their own habitat. They’re worried that some day in the future they might be personally inconvenienced. Narrow, unenlightened self-interest doesn’t impress me.

The planet has been through a lot worse than us. Been through earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tectonics, continental drift, solar flares, sun spots, magnetic storms, the magnetic reversal of the poles … hundreds of thousands of years of bombardment by comets and asteroids and meteors, worldwide floods, tidal waves, worldwide fires, erosion, cosmic rays, recurring ice ages … And we think some plastic bags and some aluminum cans are going to make a difference? The planet isn’t going anywhere. WE are!

We’re going away. Pack your shit, folks. We’re going away. And we won’t leave much of a trace, either. Maybe a little Styrofoam … The planet’ll be here and we’ll be long gone. Just another failed mutation. Just another closed-end biological mistake. An evolutionary cul-de-sac. The planet’ll shake us off like a bad case of fleas.

The planet will be here for a long, long, LONG time after we’re gone, and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself, ’cause that’s what it does. It’s a self-correcting system. The air and the water will recover, the earth will be renewed. And if it’s true that plastic is not degradable, well, the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new paradigm: the earth plus plastic. The earth doesn’t share our prejudice toward plastic. Plastic came out of the earth. The earth probably sees plastic as just another one of its children. Could be the only reason the earth allowed us to be spawned from it in the first place. It wanted plastic for itself. Didn’t know how to make it. Needed us. Could be the answer to our age-old egocentric philosophical question, “Why are we here?”

1. I would still be friends with/associate with someone who has had an abortion.

If you think abortion truly is identical to someone murdering a baby. Then there is no way you would be willing to even interact with someone who has had an abortion.

However I have a feeling if a family member came to you and said they just stabbed a 3 year old in a back alley, you would be far less likely to continue loving them than you would if a family member said they got an abortion. Despite it being identical crimes according to you. 

2.  The life of the fetus supersedes the bodily autonomy of the mother. However in cases of rape and incest abortion should still be allowed.

This line of belief makes a moral claim that bodily autonomy (a womans right to chose) is superseded by the right to life, except when the right to life is superseded by bodily autonomy (a woman being raped and forced into pregnancy).

Not only is this logically incoherent but it is also kind of just an admission that pregnancy is simply a punishment for women who dared to not keep their legs closed. 

3. I would never physically stop someone from getting an abortion. 

If you truly believed that an abortion was literally murdering a baby then you would be willing to stop it from happening regardless of the legal consequences. 

If I knew someone was legally stabbing children in some alleyway, I would absolutely physically stop them. Even if it meant being put in prison myself. 

4. I would not legally charge an endocrinologist with manslaughter if they accidentally destroyed a fertilized egg during IVF. 

During the procedure of IVF an endocrinologist physically inseminates an egg before depositing it back into a woman’s womb. However if the specialist were to accidentally destroy the sample. Then according to you they would have just committed man slaughter at best and murder at worse. 

5. I do not support giving children comprehensive sex education or giving free contraceptives to teens. 

If you truly believe that abortion was murder then you should be absolutely willing to give children comprehensive sex education. 

Since even if abortion was made illegal, abortion will still take place. 

However a statistically guaranteed way to lower rates of abortion is to give comprehensive sex ed.

On top of this giving teens access to contraceptives drastically lowers rates of abortion as well. 

If there was a nationally broadcast execution of children that happened each week. And it could be stopped by allowing a few million tax dollars being sent to the executors. You would absolutely support that money being sent. But suddenly if that money is spent on free birth control for teens then suddenly you don’t support it. Despite it lowering the rates of abortion.

Let people who want to do sex work do it. Clearly there is a public demand for it, as there has been since virtually the beginning of time, and it effects you literally 0% (unless you are a sex worker or related to one). So why all the consternation?

The conversation around sex work on this sub seems to be couched in the idea that women should not feel empowered by it and do not deserve to make money for doing such work. Which, of course, conveniently leaves out all the men who do it as well -- and yes, the majority of sex workers are female, but there are plenty of men who do it too and seem to receive about 1/100th of the vitriol directed at female sex workers on here. With all the whining here about how people don't pay attention to men's issues and it's men who are the real victims today, you'd think people wouldn't ignore male sex workers. Hmm.

I think there are legitimate issues concerning IRL sex work, around exploitation, trafficking, etc. Those are serious issues, and tbh, things that sites like OnlyFans have been able to help remedy to some extent. But those issues do not mean sex work should not happen, any more than embezzlement and insider trading mean that white-collar jobs should not happen.

Outside of those issues, perhaps someone looked at their job opportunities and thought this was by far the most lucrative. Perhaps they do it *in addition* to whatever day job they work in order to supplement their income (which is probably the smartest way to do it). Or perhaps they simply like engaging in various sexual activities and enjoy showing off and are happy to do so. Either way, clearly there is a demand for it that they are supplying.  

In summation, for the love of all that is good, please stop your bitching and moaning about sex work. It is never going to go away, and that's OK. It's not going to hurt you.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017712E2FB00>

Every year, the whole fucking island of Montreal gets split in three for a bike tour of the island. It isn't a race, it's just a gathering of obnoxious cyclists who essentially shut the whole city down for a day to get praises for biking and chucking their trash everywhere. In peoples' hedges, on their front lawns, on the sidewalk- who gives a fuck, am I right? The parks they use as rest stops are clearly just big, free-range trashcans for them to dump their garbage in.

https://www.velo.qc.ca/en/event/go-bike-montreal-festival/tour-de-lile-de-montreal/classique/

(For those who don't live in MTL).

The streets that aren't used in the tour get clogged so badly that usually quiet streets suddenly flood with bumper-to-bumper traffic as cars, public transportation, and everyone else tries to find an alternative route to where they wan to go. Even if you do want to try and bike somewhere, _you can't_. Streets crossing the roads used for the tour are barricaded and blocked by police and/or security guards, both to keep cars from running people over and to keep cyclists on the path.

Fuck you if you have to go anywhere on the other side of town during the tour de l'île. You are expected to run and play dodge the cyclists because they can't be assed to let people cross the street. Fuck you if you want to walk on the sidewalk, they have fucking cheer squads blocking off parts of the sidewalk so you have to take your chances with the cyclists.

The obnoxious cyclists who insists that everyone stops and praises them. I live on a street that the tour goes down, and you can't exit your fucking house for two seconds without hearing the ringing of fucking bike bells or the honking of bike horns as people ride past. You're expected to cheer and root for them, for... Biking down the street I guess.

And it goes on for hours, from 9am to 1pm, allegedly, but there's no hard end time... It's not unusual for it to go on an extra hour. An extra hour of sweaty assholes mooning everyone as they honk and whoop, demanding asspats for participating in a leisurely ride around the island.

To clarify; this isn't for charity or for any sort of holiday. The tour does get tax funding, but participants also have to pay to enter the race. The price of participation ranges from 10-80$. Unless you're 12 or under. Some people do use it as a chance to raise money via pledges, but the organization behind the tour is not a charity.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017712D5EFD0>

185,r7664t,The Ahmaud Arbery trial verdict was wrong,OakyFlavor2,1638447274.0,0,0.5,102,"The Narrative you've probably heard: 

3 racist guys just saw an innocent guy jogging through their neighborhood, they assumed he was stealing because he was black and decided to hunt him down and kill him in a modern day lynching.

----
The Reality:

There had been a number of burglaries in the McMicheals neighborhood and Arbery was known to the neighborhood and the police as a burglary suspect. He had been seen and caught on camera going through a house-under-construction multiple times in the middle of the night.

On the day he was killed Arbery was seen ""jogging"" through the neighborhood again. He enters the house which a neighbor sees and calls the police, he then sprints out of the house and runs down the street. The 2 McMicheals see this and then get in their truck and chase after him, a 3rd neighbor (Roddie) sees them and gets in his truck and follows them. 

The McMicheals and Roddie chase Arbery for around 4-5 minutes until we see what happens in the video - The McMicheals get ahead of Arbery and stop, Arbery runs around the truck and grabs the gun in Travis McMicheals hands. They fight over the gun and Travis ends up shooting Arbery.

----
Morally:

They didn't do anything wrong. McMichael's had good reason to suspect Arbery of committing felony burglary and any sane person seeing their friends house being broken into is going feel anger about it.

The McMicheals knew Arbery was a burglary suspect and were trying to do good on their neighbors by chasing after a suspected criminal. They weren't chasing after him to kill him, they were chasing after him to question him and detain him for the police.

They didn't shoot him because he was black. They didn't shoot him because they thought he was stealing. They shot him because he tried to grab Travis McMicheals shotgun and started punching him in the face. At that point, even if we assume the McMicheals and Rhoddie were absolutely wrong about everything before; It is completely unreasonable to say they should or could have done anything else other than defend themselves by shooting Arbery.

With Roddie it's not even a question, all he did was follow, film, and call the police. 

----
Legally:

The McMichaels never actually attempted to detain Arbery. They never attacked, restrained, or pointed their weapons at him. They merely followed him whilst asking him to stop and talk.

However, the McMichael's absolutely had reasonable and probable grounds to suspect Ahmaud Arbery of committing felony burglary. This (should have) secured them the right to detain Arbery until police could arrive and investigate. They were lawfully open carrying firearms, an inviolable right recognized by the Second Amendment and entirely reasonable when detaining a suspected fleeing felon. Rather than stopping and waiting for law enforcement to arrive, Arbery attempted to wrestle a weapon from one of them. This escalated a ""detainment"" on suspicion of burglary to putting McMichaels in fear of imminent death under which use of deadly force is permitted.

Additionally, in the trial both the prosecution and defense agreed that whether anything they did was legal depends on whether they were justified in performing a citizens arrest. The Georgia citizens arrest law is just 2 sentences:

*""A private person may arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge. If the offense is a felony and the offender is escaping or attempting to escape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion.""*

The defense argued that the first sentence is referring to misdemeanors and the second is referring to felonies. The prosecution argued that both sentences applied to felonies. 

The defenses interpretation makes sense; If it's a misdemeanor you need to have absolute certainty that a crime took place before you tackle someone to the ground. If it's a felony, and they are running away, you only need to have a reasonable suspicion that someone did something before you chase after them. Again this makes sense, it's not sensible for someone to detain a kid because they think he just shoplifted a box of cookies. It is sensible for someone to chase after a guy who looks like he just committed a murder.

The prosecutions argument doesn't; They were arguing that you need 100% certainty of any crime and **also** 51% suspicion if it's a felony before you can perform a citizens arrest. 
Not only does this not make any logical sense to be interpreted that way it does not make sense fore the state to write the law that way.

When a situation like this occurs where there are disagreements about the interpretation of the law under the rule of lenity the judge is supposed to judge in favor of the defense. As the state had complete control over how the law was written any ambiguity should be ruled in favor of the defense. Instead what the judge did was give the jury both interpretations and let them decide. This is a horrible improper way of judging a trial.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017712EDA9E8>

Left leaning individuals reject religion (and the ones they create for themselves, like wokeness, are a poor substitute for the real thing), they typically have less or no children so are less likely to benefit from family (especially in later years), are more insular and less friendly people in general and therefore have less 'real' friends to lean on and truly bond with, and reject the core principles of work and the pride and self-worth that comes with it.  

And completely embracing one pillar (like throwing yourself into your career almost entirely) is not a good substitute for neglecting the other pillars.  Three pillars can stand on their own absent one, but not just one or two.  So it is possible to embrace 3 of the 4 and find contentment in life.

The worst example I have of this are influencers/YouTube comedians who try and talk politics. I won't name names but there are a certain number of them who act like they care about the poor but simply tokenize them so they can look like an activist.

The other reason I have for why the rich/ middle class shouldn't speak for the poor is that by growing up with money it is impossible to relate to someone who lived without. You may imagine what it is like but too many times the rich stereotype and belittle the poor by treating them like a pet. The only people truly qualified to talk about the lower class are those who have lived it. When the rich act like they know what it's like it often is very insulting and disingenuous.

When I first proposed the rule change in modmail, my intention was to ban racist and discriminatory behavior. However, as I’ve recently found out from senior mod staff (whom I will not name, as I do not endorse doxxing), the new rule would be used to ban discussion in support of certain religious practices, namely one often associated with Judaism and Islam. This goes contrary to what I wanted the rule to stand for. By banning discussion of that topic, it sets the precedent for religious discrimination in moderating, which I am absolutely against.

I don't buy that for a second. When your kids are young their behavior is a direct reflection on your parenting skills. If they are loud, obnoxious, insolent little shits who speak without being spoken to by adults or act inappropriately in public that is and should be a reflection on the parents. I hardly ever blame the kid. I blame the parents. 

When children grow up into adolescence and teenage years their behavior is ALSO a reflection on their parenting. If they turn into a goth or something that's embarrassing for the parents, and it's likely due to some deficiency in their parenting skills. 

When children grow up and get jobs they are STILL direct reflections on their parents' ability to built an adult man or woman who is capable of supporting themselves and/or their families. If they grow up to be a welfare mooch or a Wendy's porter then that is a reflection on the job their parents did. 

Now, this doesn't absolve children from responsibility for their own life and decisions. Parents guide and teach their children and are very responsible for how they turn out, but the child should also see this fact and strive to improve themselves and make the most of themselves so as to reflect well upon their parents.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177130C00B8>

I’m asking the UK Government to criminalise circumcision, no  exceptions for Religious circumstances, unless it has to be done for  medical reasons, such as an infection. Parents or medical professionals  found Circumcising children otherwise should be prosecuted accordingly.

More details 

The fact that FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) is criminalised but MGM isn’t is extremely sexist & wrong.   
 

MGM can have a profound effect on children’s mental health and it is often done without the child’s consent.   
 

I am asking that performing or allowing MGM to be performed be made a  specific criminal offence. Where a parent is involved the penalties  should include losing their child.

I am a gay man, but the custody issue touches on something that affects me too: that men are less likely to be seen as nurturing, good parents. 

Let me lay what I think are two core issues of this matter and how feminists address those problems.

---

**Problem:** Society's vision of men being seen as less nurturing (by comparison of society seeing women as nurturers)

**Feminist solution:** Dissociate nurturing from womanhood. By removing the expectation that women be nurturing, this social bias in rulings will be mitigated. Encouraging boys and men to embrace nurturing behaviors and creating a social environment where those behaviors are not seen as weak is definitely concordant with feminist views on the issue.


---

**Problem:** Women are more likely to be stay-at-home caregivers and to do most of the emotional labor of child rearing. When assessing the welfare of the child the parent who does most of the labor of child rearing usually gets custody, that happens to be women more often.
 
**Feminist solution:** Women enter the workforce more often and men become stay at home dads more often. The more a man engages in the physical and emotional labor of child rearing, the more likely he will be seen as a viable candidate for custody. By creating more situations where it is clear that the father performs many of the duties of child rearing it will make a stronger case for the father keeping custody of the child.

---

On top of the adequacy of these feminist solutions, I see a lot of men's rights spaces advocating a sort of traditional masculinity that at times eschews nurturing behaviors or sees staying at home to care for children as emasculating. And to those people, they can't exactly have it both ways to continue playing into a societal belief of men as emotionally distant providers and also believing that they should be granted custody of their children (who unquestionably need nurturing to develop into healthy adults).",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017713108278>

Having sex for fun is like eating when you're not really hungry. I've had sex for the last time 3 years ago and not focusing on it is great. Somehow, it turns out focusing on things that are either more productive or an easier way of having fun wastes less of my time and energy. Sure, sex feels good, but so do many other things that don't require as much compromise. 

Then you have the people who bring up the health benefits of having sex. Sure, it does have its benefits. The benefits of having sex for an hour are also easily outweighed by eating a Kit Kat or a hot dog the next minute. These benefits are minimal; you don't see people whose extreme health can be linked to sex. Plus, there are better ways to ensure your health that also don't depend on having to find someone who's down to do that with you first. Going for a walk is completely free. 

Unless you're in a relationship, finding partners to have sex with is mostly an expensive and tiresome thing. The effort-to-benefit ratio is extremely low. Most people won't last longer than 30 minutes (and if you do last longer than that, odds are one of you is getting sore and bored), so sex is really a crack addiction. People fiend for their 15 minute high. 

And as for people in relationships, sex is really just a shared addiction. It's what they do when they can't think of anything better to do. 

Masturbation is a healthier, safer way of getting sexual relief and I legitimately don't get why it's seen as something so bad by sex addicts. It's literally just solo sex. If you're one of these people who see sex as socially successful and masturbation as a loser thing, you're out your mind and completely self-absorbed. The difference is that masturbation is a personal thing that's not gonna bother anyone. 

Society is obsessed with sex. People are blinded by it because it's this pleasant thing that everyone is in favor of. It's like being told you can eat chocolate all you want. Addiction always gets out of hand when society says it's good. There's always that one article with often made up health benefits of sex telling people to just go and be indulgent.

Maybe, sure, in your childhood you have people around you all the time to make those decisions for you, but you're also not thinking about the pain and burden of participating in this capitalist society.  The second you get an ounce of freedom and the thought ""I didn't consent to being born"" you can withdraw your consent simply.  The fact that you are still alive to complain about your lack of consent to life means that you don't truly care that nobody asked to birth you.  You have to enjoy your life somewhat, because it's really fucking easy to stop having one if you hate it as much as you say.

Their main complaint is that life is pure suffering, and that nobody should have to go through that.  Yet, they continue purposely staying alive through their suffering and most do fuck all to try and lower the suffering in the world.

They talk about all the horrible things your kid could end up as or doing.  That's why you shouldn't even have the kid.  That kind of life has no value for anyone, especially them, so they shouldn't even live.

What they're inadvertently saying is that people who are actually in those situations shouldn't be alive.  I think you can guess what that could do to a person in those situations stumbling across an antinatalist.

I would like to compare these people to the ""edgy"" people (especially teens and young adults) who I bet most people not entirely sheltered have ran across at least once in their lives.  They usually have a couple unfortunate things about them, maybe their parents genuinely suck, or they have a slight deformity, or poverty, or whatever.  They also supposedly have a lot of vague or normal things wrong with their lives, such as a ""shitty life"" or bad grades.  They then complain about it non stop as if it's their only personality trait until someone (usually a little younger or less privileged) comes along and agrees that they have some things wrong too.  The edgy person then adds things to their list for the younger person to relate to, until they eventually start talking about wanting to k*ll themselves, hurt themselves, start acting like they have an ED, or start using drugs.  They'll show some signs of genuinely wanting to do any of those things even if they have no intention of actually doing it.  This allows the younger/,less privileged person to think that's how they can fix everything, and then they actually commit to some of it or find the actual help they need.  As soon as that person is gone, the edgy person finds someone else to take their place.  Rinse and repeat.

That is exactly what they're doing.  They're repeating,
""Life sucks."" until someone else says,
""yeah life sucks""
""I should start making bad choices""
""You can do that?  Oh.. uh... ☠️""

Regardless, I hope everyone enjoys their thanksgiving.

----

Some people say talking politics with your family on thanksgiving is a bad idea.  Others encourage it, for example, in 2013, Barack and Michelle Obama not only told young democrats that they should talk to their families about health care at thanksgiving, and even gave them a [list of fourteen talking points](https://web.archive.org/web/20131128072538/http://www.barackobama.com/health-care-holidays/) to make sure that their relatives bought a new health care plan on the new exchange.  (Protip:  Find someone who loves you like Democrats love big Pharma.)

My advice - don't talk politics, or at least not directly.  Because the problem is you won't be able to agree on the basic facts, and that's because of [this one statistic](https://news.gallup.com/poll/321116/americans-remain-distrustful-mass-media.aspx):  75% of Democrats have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in the media to report the news accurately and fairly, vs 10% of Republicans, and let's face it, they can't both be right.  So instead, of either confronting or avoiding any political discussion, why not take the opportunity to compare notes and see if both sides are on the same page  in terms of what's actually happening?

Here are a few stories from one of my favorite center-right blogs, Legal Insurrection, that I think conservatives are aware of but liberals may not be.   While LI ""just a blog"", every story is well sourced and you can check it with secondary and often primary sources, and I would be 100% confident in bringing anything from them up.  (And as stated the goal is -not- to argue the story, but just to see if the other side is aware of it at all.)

However, I would encourage liberals to share their own stories to, to see if conservatives are aware of them.  But please be aware that conservatives don't believe something just because the NYT reports it - not after the Fine People hoax, Brian Sicknick, Russian bounties on dead US troops, Trump killing the USPS, Rittenhouse the ""white supremacist"", etc etc, so you would have to back the stories up with primary and secondary sources to make it credible.

Good luck & if you give this a try, tell us how it goes.

Of course this is dependent on country, but I see this often from people in USA saying how the economy or how things are more expensive leads people no room for dating, or tinder is bad for dating etc. The common concern is 'well when men are single, they become violent incels'. It is either a) sexist to assume men will become violent or b) if it is true that they become violent, then some body fucked up in raising them. And no, I'm not blaming just men. Both men and women involved in raising this fucking twat would be guilty. We as a society need to drill it in people's head that its ok to not get what you want, but it's not people's fault. Society doesn't need to shaped in a way that gives you what you want if it comes at the expense of others.

Looking at this, you need to ask yourself, why are (assuming your fears are true) men becoming more violent when single than women when there is an equal amount of single women?

For example, if I as a highly sexual person finds that the sex workers market is small and very few male sex workers exist to cater to my needs, it's not a failing of the society. If a society has a small market for ugly men or whatever women find unattractive, society doesn't need to be shaped in such a way that allows them to find a partner.

The unpopular part is, I'm fine with tinder. If I can't find a partner in real life because most people decide to put their efforts on tinder, so be it. I'm old school, and it's fine if the dating world doesn't work the way I work.

If the dating world is formed in such a way that increase the amount of single men and women, that's people's choice. If you are whining about people not dating you, well, that's their choice.

I have zero compassion for people who think that society is failing because they can't get what they want. Just feels like princess syndrome.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017714B1C3C8>

USA isn't perfect. But I think USA is the only country that is the most free in terms of speech laws. Googling UK arrest for tweet for example and you will see the tweets are mean, but  I don't think meanness is enough or should be enough to arrest people. People need yo a) grow thicker skin and recognize such meanness can lead to political parties calling any criticism mean. This sets a dangerous society. 

I say this as an Asian who has had people say extremely mean stuff to me. I still wouldn't want my bullies arrested unless they actually touched me. (Some were mild like 'Asian food stinks, eew what are you eating, to meaner things)

Plus if I see my neighbours mean tweets I'll know to avoid them. I think Americans are more honest and I don't like dishonesty 

I know I made a post about loving USA gun laws and its true, if not for family and friend ties, I think I would move to USA in a heartbeat if I could. It has its flaws, but all its pros are so much better.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017714C994A8>
