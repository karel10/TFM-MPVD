wing liberals usually think that ethnicity is something one can choose or that it\u2019s entirely a cultural thing, while ethnicity is certainly cultural to a very large extent that isn\u2019t the only aspect of it, it\u2019s also a matter of ancestry, if a French man and a Russian woman have a kid born and raised in Germany that kid will **not** be ethnically German in any way, a German citizen? Yes, of course. Culturally German? Very much possible. **Ethnically** German? No, ethnically can\u2019t be chosen, if you\u2019re born a specific ethnicity you can\u2019t change it.\n\nLiberals say this is racist but i don\u2019t see how that\u2019s the case, i am **not** in **any way** saying a person should be treated a certain way based on their ethnicity, but to pretend that ethnicity is entirely cultural and that ancestry has no role in defining it just isn\u2019t true.","1":"Unless you are willing to do that for every opinion and every group, you should not do it.\n\nFor one you act like one ethnicity and all the genders are some homogenous group. That frankly is just gross. For example, suppose I said I was against gun restrictions and you said \"oh look another alpha man\" this is bad for all genders. It assumes that men are this homogeny of gun loving. It also assumes none men, usually women are this homogeny of anti gun.\n\nPlus mentioning peoples gender is not a counter to any argument. \n\nif its not OK to assume someone is black because they made, say an opinion you don't like, you shouldnt do it assuming someone is white either. Suppose I said \"you have a dumb opinion, you must be black\" that of course is not OK. Neither is it OK to say \"I assume you are white because of your opinion I disagree with\" this assumes only white people can be in the group you disagree with. \n\nFurther more, this is hurtful to people who are not white. It assumes the groups that are not white are not diverse at all. \n\nAnd if people will say \"but statistically people who support trump identify as white\" then I can say, statistically people who do x are black. \n\nEither are standards are the same for all or we rid it for all.","2":"I think the strongest criticism comes from people who have never actually watched the show. Many critics will watch small clips of Carlson that are out of context and are fooled into believing he\u2019s saying something ridiculous. Furthermore, he does a great job of covering controversial subjects by stating facts that people don\u2019t want to hear, but still need to know in order to understand an issue. He really shined in mid 2020 when he provided great coverage and commentary of all the events taking place during that period.","3":"The left is calling for federal laws that enshrine the right to get elective abortions, while some people on the right are calling for federal laws that restrict abortion or outlaw it in all cases.\n\nHere are my thoughts on the type of federal abortion legislation we need: Enshrine the right to get an abortion if the pregnancy is the result of a rape, incest, or the fetus has a serious deformity, or if the life\/health of the mother is in danger if she delivers the baby -- but simultaneously outlaw any abortions that happen after viability.\n\nViability is the point where if the baby was extracted from the womb prematurely, it would still live and likely have a normal life. Once the baby reaches that point, it is a human, and aborting it is murder, plain and simple. Before viability is more of a grey area, so this legislation would allow the states to come up with their own laws, and the local populations could decide what type of restrictions they are going to have on abortions -- however, these states wouldn't be allowed to completely outlaw abortion in the case of a rape, incest, etc. as I listed above.\n\nI think this is a fair compromise, it gives states a lot of freedom to decide how they want abortion laws to be, which ultimately gives power back to the local population. This legislation also restricts the morally reprehensible parts of both sides though, such as killing babies after viability, or forcing women who were raped to deliver the baby.","4":"As a stripper, I have had to explain feminine nature to countless virgins or uneducated males who have zero clue how to please a woman sexually or romantically. I feel like a sex-ed teacher half the time to younger men. People villainize the industry on reddit and youtube saying how lonely most of the men are, but many of the lonely men learn through escorts, chaturbate streamers, female twitch streamers, and onlyfans girls about females and romance. People come to me for advice all the time about why they are unattractive, how to have sex, or how to get a girlfriend. In a way, I almost see it as a snowboarding instructor or another skilled instructor. Just because the activity is fun does not mean we should be demonized. Men are already lonely before they come to sex workers, so without us many of these men would have even less of a chance with normal girls due to their inexperience.","5":"I\u2019ve noticed that certain people on this sub tend to throw around that word for anything even slightly left-leaning. I\u2019ve also noticed radical SJW-types and wannabe revolutionaries labelling themselves communists because \u2018they support equality\u2019.\n\n\nMost people have no idea what the hammer and sickle actually represent.\n\n\nHere\u2019s what isn\u2019t communist:\n\n- taxes\n\n- universal healthcare & education\n\n- universal basic income\n\n- separation of church and state\n\n- democrats (including Sanders and AOC)\n\n- Europe\n\n- liberals\n\n- handouts to the unemployed\/lazy\n\n- environmental regulations\n\n- the anti-work movement\n\n- gun regulation\n\n- totalitarianism\n\nWhile certain communist philosophies do include a few of these, the mere presence of them does not make the concept or the society communist.\n\n\nOne particularly egregious one is UBI. The concept was initially developed by right-wing economists to help maintain income security so that people could keep spending and keep the market alive, but has come to be associated with communism, a philosophy that is so pro-labour it would despise UBI.","6":"on friday, roe v wade was overturned. like many people, i am absolutely livid about this fact. it is one of the most disgraceful moments in US history and america should be ashamed to have this moment in it\\`s history books. however, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. this is going to inspire liberals to take action against the evil that is the republican party. they are finally realizing that something must be done. a recent article has revealed that many more democrats are planning to vote after this overturning. another article also said that the republican party is afraid by how this will affect the future. and quite frankly, they should be afraid. because they have doomed themselves. while i\\`m sure that the republican party will someday take power again, after this overturning, it will probably be a while. i suspect that it will probably be years or even decades before we have another republican president. the american people have learned from their mistakes and are planning to do whatever they can to prevent history from repeating itself. congratulations republicans of america. you may have won the battle...but you are on the verge of losing the war.","7":"[removed]","8":"At the end of the day, its about whether abortion should be legal or illegal, at what point. That's it. Nothing else matters. because I notice a lot of people say they are pro life and that gets people to bring up stuff like foster care. If they don't want people to bring that up, they should not call themselves pro life. As someone who used to call myself pro life, I believe even if I wanted abortion illegal I wouldn't say it anymore because some people do not deserve life. I have no problem with capital punishment.\n\nOn the flip, though I support abortion being legal I find being pro choice of course isn't a good thing for everyone either. Some people might support a woman's right to choose an abortion, but not a criminals right to freedom to choose where to live (of course) \n\nIn my opinion 'pro choicers' also make dumb arguments. I also heard of people argue that criminals get their freedom removed because of violating the social contract. Then if abortion is illegal, no problem arresting people who try to get an abortion right?.\n\nI know you say they are unrelated. That's the point though. saying pro choice or pro life distracts from the main topic.","9":"So many people are convinced they are doing something by tweeting about, or flooding Reddit, with their political beliefs. You are not changing anything by promoting progressive ideals on social media. Straight up. In fact, I'd argue many people are harming the movement by spending all their time and energy on social media. Don't we realize that capitalist America would much rather have us online than in the streets protesting or putting progressive ideals into action by running for office? It's easy for politicians to ignore the angry Twitter mob, but it's a lot harder for them to ignore protesters outside their house or another political candidate challenging their beliefs.\n\nI'm convinced nobody has ever changed their political beliefs based off a tweet, or a reddit argument. I loathe the term, but when Reddit is flooded with political commentary without any action it just feels like disingenuous \"virtue signaling\".\n\nr\/antiwork is one of the biggest subreddits but what really is the point other than to complain? Believe me, I appreciate the sentiment but that sub is not going to reform anything. Sure, you could say it's \"raising awareness\" but what good has that actually caused? We saw what happened when that mod went on Fox News.

BUT:\n\nPer [a recent article](https:\/\/www.insider.com\/gen-z-reconsiders-sex-wake-of-possible-post-roe-world-2022-6), Gen-Zers have stated that this ruling will \"deter [them] from casual sex\". \n\nBecause we know [from studies](https:\/\/royalsociety.org\/news\/2015\/01\/men-are-less-promiscuous-when-women-are-scarce\/) that more choice in sex partners leads to promiscuity, it follows that less choice leads to less promiscuity (or more monogamy\/abstinence). I believe this will overall lead to more stable relationships. Either that, or we will simply become more abstinent overall. But I'm banking on the former.\n\nBefore someone calls me a \"sexist, controlling asshole\" again, know that I didn't vote for this ruling, and also am not even an advocate for it.

I am also an asshole though, so you got me there.","12":"What the fuck has happened to this country? Do I live in Afghanistan or the United States of fucking America?! Are we actually forcing women to stop having sex to avoid the risk of receiving a murder charge? What kind of fundamentalist logic is this? Abortions have always existed and will continue to exist until the end of time. Whether that means American women will have to start stabbing metal coat hangers into their vaginas like women in Haiti, or consume poison, you will not control the autonomy of another human being. Prepare yourselves for the spike in suicides and self-mutilations that are about to start in this country. Your self-righteous bullshit is going to ruin lives. Choosing the life of a non-sentient clump of cells over that of a fully developed human woman tells me this country has only regressed. \n\nAs a form of protest, as many women as possible should immediately refuse to engage in all hetero intercourse to intentionally cause the birthrate in this country to fall.

You cannot force someone to go through with pregnancy. That is THEIR body. And please don\u2019t bother with the bullshit argument about personal responsibility. Women should be able to have as much sex as they want. Liberal attitudes towards sex is a defining feature of Western \u201cfreedom\u201d and culture. And if that happens to cause pregnancy, they should be freely able to access abortion pills or a sterile D&C. Taking this away will shift everything about our culture and submit women to unreasonable punishment.

Yet, all of these rights are considered indispensable in any functioning democracy. Could you imagine states even being allowed to touch the right to procreate?\n\nHell, even the power of judicial review (the ability of the SC to declare a Legislative or Executive act in violation of the Constitution) is not in the text of the constitution; it was established in 1803 by the Supreme Court itself in the case of Marbury v. Madison (1803).\n\nMy point is that while there may or may not be other justifications for overturning Roe v Wade, the 'constitutional rights' argument is probably the worst one, since (a) the ninth amendment exists, and (b) if a right can be stripped based on the fact that it isn't in the constitution, it places all of the above rights in danger.","16":"People that were invoking \"my body my choice\" in discussions regarding mandatory covid vaccination, who are now happy for the overturning of Roe vs Wade, are hypocrites of the highest order.

I am pro-abortion\/choice, and against any kind of mandatory vaccination. If you disagree with this sentiment then I think you are a hypocrite.","17":"All the people in the pro choice crowd keep saying that abortion is banned when it's not. It's simply letting the states decide their own abortion laws. It's especially hilarious seeing people in strong blue states freak out over this when they won't be effected at all. There is no doubt in my mind that states in California and New York will keep abortion legal for all cases up until 9 months. Heck they might even allow for post birth if they can. Just a wild guess here but probably about half the states will allow abortion on demand up until the day the baby is outside the womb. \n\nSome states will probably ban late term abortions and a few more 2nd trimester abortions. The only states that honestly might abandon all elective abortions will probably be Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas but even those states will still allow for the life of the mother. Even people in the states with strict abortion laws are still going to be able to drive on over to the next state. So there you go all the states will allow for abortions if the mother's life is at risk and most will allow 1st trimester abortions and quite a few states will have it on demand anytime for any reason. So really most of the people who are pro choice already live in areas that will allow it anyways and the people who want to get an abortion will be able to do it anyways since most states will at least allow 1st trimester which is when almost all abortions happen anyways. I'm more on the pro life side but even if I was pro choice I wouldn't be freaking out.","18":"If you only surround yourself with people who share your views, you're basically creating an echo-chamber around yourself.

As seen in the whole verse about a camel entering the eye of a needle being easier than a rich dude entering heaven for example. It reads almost like a person who never worked a day in their lives seeing some random rich guy walking down the street and then writing in their diary about how much they hate that they don't get enough welfare and  handouts and how that rich dude *must* be the evil one. It's so blatantly collectivistic and anti-individual that I find it hilarious how so-called 'rugged individualist' conservatives who claim to support unrestricted laissez-faire capitalism will proceed to talk about Jesus and recite cherry-picked verses.\n\nIt looks to me almost like a reversal of the worldview and systems prior to Christianity:organized religion turned things upside down by declaring the strong and successful 'evil' while declaring the weak and submissive 'good'. This is literally just modern socialism's disdain for people who are successful and live for themselves rather than giving out free stuff,but with a bit of mysticism mixed in. \n\nLook at the 'seven deadly sins':greed,pride,sloth,envy,wrath,lust,gluttony. To me personally,this looks like a way of guilt-tripping people for having an animalistic side because,after all,humans are still an animal. Why? Because all of these 'sins' are completely natural:not only that,but they are even *useful*. \n\nYou can use greed as a motivation to succeed. Pride the same. Envy the same. Wrath you would use to take revenge on your enemies. Lust (for success) drives you to become the most ambitious you can be. Gluttony and sloth? This can just be interpreted as indulging in and enjoying the results of your success.\n\nReligion is anti-nature,anti-individual and anti-logic. It is based on emotional manipulation and 'faith' in unproven concepts based on superstition. Any *true* conservative who genuinely believes in a society based on individualism first and foremost and has as his life motto 'DON'T TREAD ON ME' will reject religion altogether and base his beliefs purely on reason. Evangelical 'conservatives' are just totalitarian pseudocommunists attempting to control people and take away everyone's right to autonomy.\n\n\nAll authoritarianism is based on destroying people's autonomy through herd mentality and forced conformity:Religious zealots? \"Your property belongs to God,not you!\" Communists? \"Your property belongs to everyone,not just you!\" Fascism? \"Your property belongs to the nation,not you!\" . The first basis for establishing a state based on force and coercion like this is emotional manipulation. All conservatives who promote religion are merely socialists in disguise,refusing to acknowledge and denying that their religious book is one based on doctrines that sanctify and glorify submissiveness and weakness while demonizing ambition and success. Any conservative who has any level of actual self-respect and self-awareness should be an atheist if they genuinely believe in putting the individual above the collective as they like to claim they do.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED-Talk.","27":"Then everyone can be happy and all this intense political fighting and deep polarization can finally end. This is how I would implement it:\n\n* first, democrats and republicans should fork the constitution and propose changes to it as they see fit (e.g. the democrat constitution guarantees abortion and gay rights, the republican constitution more explicitly and expansively guarantees speech and gun laws).\n\n* then, the residents of each state votes to choose which constitution they would like to adopt. the side with >50% of the votes wins for each state.\n\n* each state becomes a state in one of the two new countries\n\n* once the voting is done, all people will be given a two-year time period where they can move to a state which will be in the country of their choice, if they are not in it already. once the two-year period is up, they will become a citizen of the country where there state is in.\n\n* we will have european style freedom of movement between the two new countries enshrined in the constitution of both countries. but one side can do border checks if they like (e.g. to prevent illegal immigration).\n\n* we should also have a robust free trade agreement enshrined in the constitution of both countries.\n\n* lastly, to start with, both countries will inherit the current statutes and common law, then each countries legislature can repeal or modify as they see fit.","28":"I am a neolibertarian (something in between a neocon and a libertarian).

If we had a weak republican (e.g. Jeb Bush), we probably wouldn't have been able to get a third justice in there. Or he probably would have capitulated to the Democrats and nominated Merrick Garland. But not Trump! He steamrolled the Democrats and man handled them.

In other words, you believe that the baby's life takes precedence over the bodily autonomy of the pregnant individual. \n\n**THEN** you must also support a policy of mandatory organ donation in any case where it is viable. This would include people who are adamantly against having their own organs removed post-mortem, so long as they remain in tact afterwards, just as anti-abortion policy forces those who would prefer to have an abortion to bring their baby to term.\n\nOrgan donation is a life-saving medical procedure that takes organic material from one body, and gives it to another, who would not be able to keep living without it.

It will still develop, in time, into a human being provided it doesn't miscarry like 10-15% of most pregnancies. \n\nHowever, if seen as a moral punishment of a woman for her misdeeds, this exception makes perfect sense. A woman who willingly had sex must be forced to carry a child to term as a method of control or punishment by society, unless it really isn't her fault that the sex occurred. This is much more consistent with the rape\/incest exceptions. \n\nI'm willing to accept that this is about societal control over women rather than punishment, and I won't take that as a change in my view though I'm still interested in discussion. \n\nAnd primarily I'm interested to see if there's any rational for that exception to an abortion ban that leaves the ban with an internally consistent philosophy that isn't about punishing or controlling women.","31":"I\u2019m pro-life but abortions should be safe, legal and rare. For far to long congress has avoided regulating this issue. Democrats had 50 years to ensure abortion safeguards and continuously avoided doing so even though they campaigned on it.

The youngest viable baby was born at 21 weeks. Anything after that both lives should be taken into consideration.\n\nNow that the Supreme Court has righted this historical wrong that allowed killing of healthy babies for profit.

Here are the basic definitions:\n\n**Deontology:** right and wrong are determined by set absolute immutable moral 'laws' or rules. Actions which abide by these moral rules are regarded as more ethical than actions which break these moral rules.\n\n**Utilitarianism:** right and wrong are determined by their consequences; it can basically be summed up as \"the greatest good for the greatest majority\". Basically, actions which increase net happiness and well-being are regarded as more ethical than actions which reduce net happiness and well-being.\n\nBased on these definitions, I think it is fair to say that left-wingers are utilitarian, while right-wingers are deontological. Right-wingers are more likely to stick to certain rules like less taxes or the free market, even if circumventing those concepts could lead to greater net happiness. Left-wingers are more likely to evaluate the action by their consequence on the net well-being of people, even if these actions run directly against concepts like right to life. What does this mean in practice? I'll try to illustrate it using abortion rights as an example:\n\n**Right-wing:** Moral rule: taking an innocent life is wrong. Life begins at conception. Ergo, abortions should be largely restricted.\n\n**Left-wing:** People will get abortions regardless of restrictions. They should be able to get those in safe medical settings even if it kills the foetus. Reducing abortion restriction saves more lives, which increases net happiness. Ergo, abortions should be largely unrestricted.\n\nThis is just something I've noticed frequently in my interactions, I'd love to hear other views on this.","38":"A fetus is quite literally a developing human. \n\nPeople go into semantics about when a fetus qualifies as a human, but to me, the question is less about what it is now, than how it is developing &amp;amp; what it becomes.\n\nIf a fetus is developing normally, then for all intents and purposes, it will eventually become a human. Ergo, to abort before it can finish it\u2019s development, is essentially murdering a human before they\u2019re born.\n\n**Every** multicellular organism is a \u201ccluster of cells\u201d.

I would rather people just not have sex, or if they do to use proper protection, but I know better. I know they make stupid decisions out of sheer horniness.\n\nI don\u2019t think women should have to deal with the burden of 9 months of pregnancy, and even if it\u2019s safer now, childbirth is still one of the worst pains a human can feel and they shouldn\u2019t have to experience that.\n\nNot to mention the monetary, time, and emotional investment of raising a child, they are a huge responsibility that not everyone is prepared for. \n\nAnd for some reason a lot of people don\u2019t put their unwanted children up for adoption, leading to abusive\/resentful parents and a shitty childhood for the kid.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFor  the record, despite what people say, I know the repeal of Roe vs Wade doesn\u2019t make abortion illegal.

I have plenty of friends whose political views are different from mine, but the reason why I am friends with them is because they aren't assholes about it.\n\nFor the record, I hate extremism as a whole, no matter if its from the right or the left. It's important to keep an open mind. I'm able to do so, but I don't think the majority of people in my state are; and it's doing nothing but alienating us from the rest of the nation. I think California could easily survive as its own nation, and I honestly think that the rest of the US could survive without us. They are more united with each other than California will be with any of them, unless the people here suddenly have a wake-up call and make more of an effort to work with, as opposed to against, the rest of the nation.\n\nOne last thing; even though I think California should secede and become its own nation doesn't necessarily mean that I would want to continue living here if we did so.","45":"[deleted]","46":" Now women will be forced to raise a child for 18 years without a say in the matter like men do.\n\nEnjoy your gender equality ladies!

It is set in a world where western nations are fighting with utopian terrorists over the world's most valuable resources -- in other words, it is set in a world a lot like ours.  In fact I'd guess that there are people who played Command and Conquer in the 90s as teenagers and by the early 00s were driving tanks across oil Iraqi oil fields taking out [technicals](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technical_\\(vehicle\\)).\n\nThe strategic loop in Command and Conquer is as simple as it gets - you need resources to build military units, and you need military units to control resources.  Which means that when you see your opponents collecting resources, it's only a matter of time before there's going to be a bunch of tanks and troops headed your way.\n\nAnd that's a great lesson, because in the real world, when countries build militarizes and invade resource-rich areas, like the US invading Iraq and Russia invading Ukraine, most of the debate is about how the war started, whether it was justified, what the goals are, etc.  Nobody really wants to admit that the point of having a large military isn't to just have it sit on the sidelines, its to acquire and defend resources, and yet the conflicts generally play out exactly that way, with troops being sent to poorly defended and resource-rich areas.\n\nA related lesson is that when you give or cede resources to hostile actors, they're almost guaranteed to be used against you at some point.  Europe never countered Russian aggression in Crimea or Georgia and continued to buy energy from them, and yet was somehow surprised when they invaded the Ukraine. Likewise, after the Iranian revolution, people were surprised that the new regime immediately launched an attack on Iraq..  And just this year the Taliban have just been given control of a country and billions of dollars in weapons, and in about a year everyone will be surprised when they attack one of their neighbors or even our allies.  Instead of being surprised all the time, we should heed the lessons of C&C and be prepared.\n\nAnother important lesson from Command and Conquer is that you always need to be able to understand the conflict from the perspective of your opponent .  That's because if you want to stop a Hitler, Stalin, Bin Laden, or Putin, the very first thing you need to do is to think like them.  And there is absolutely nothing unpatriotic or wrong about having that discussion even though some people try to tell you differently.  (That you're supporting Putin or the terrorists or whatever by acknowledging that they have goals and motivations.)\n\nIn Command and Conquer it is also pretty easy to send a few flame tanks or engineers to blow up an opponents harvester or a grab a building or two and sell them, but ultimately you can't win the game that way, it just a delaying tactic at best.  Terrorism in the real world is very similar - it results in loss of life and makes headlines, but really doesn't change the power dynamic because ultimately it just consuming resources.  This explains why after the 9\/11 attacks, terrorists shifted their focus from attacks in developed countries to attacks in weaker countries in which governments could be established, for example Syria, Yemen, and attacking the weak government in Iraq, and also why the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had little lasting impact.\n\nSchools have been making headlines lately, and not in a good way - teaching kindergartners about gender identity or teenagers how privileged or oppressed they are.  Incorporating Command and Conquer into the curriculum would be a useful educational tool for understanding geopolitics and developing new strategies and tactics in the war on terror.  It would also motivate students to learn how to build the advanced technologies available in the game, such as the Ion cannon, tesla coil, mammoth tank, and the mobile construction vehicle.  Used properly, it could grab the attention of today's apathetic students and create a new generation of leaders ready and willing to defend civilization if it deserves to be defended, or else overthrow it if it becomes too corrupt and authoritarian, both noble goals  that seem to have been lost by the preceding generations..","54":"[removed]","55":"Its unpopular to be able to agree with both sides now. \nOf course there is more nuance, but people shit on the anti socialists when they have legit concerns. and vice versa.

Example: California has a population of 39.35m people and America has   329.5m people. California has 12% of the population, so they get 12   electoral votes. All states and territories add up to 101 so they're all   represented and there can be no ties. The amount each state gets is   based on the most recently complete census at the time.\n2. Voter ID.

Polls need to close at 8, and there needs to be universal standards as   to when the cutoff is. I know in Philadelphia, if you're waiting in  line  when polls close, you still get to vote. That makes the votes in  that  are vulnerable to manipulation. It should be polls close 8PM with  or  without you. If you care about the election, you'll find a way to  get  there.\n4. Mail-ins.

It would be impossible to please everybody.\n\nAlso, every living organism in the history (and prehistory) of living things is hardwired in their nature to make decisions that chiefly benefit the decision-maker.\n\nJust becuase it benefits yourself at someone else's **inconvenience** does not make it selfish. It's when it benefits yourself at someone else's **expense.**\n\nExample: Selfish is a greedy business owner who lays off employees so he could save enough for his vacation home. He made a decision that benefited himself (saving money) at the **expense** of other people (they lost their jobs).\n\nSelfish is NOT taking the last pack of cosmic brownies at ShopRite. It benefitted yourself (you got the brownies) but it was at someone else's **inconvenience** (they simply didn't get the brownies).\n\nI've also been hearing a lot of people use that word during the pandemic. I'm not selfish for wanting to go to a baseball game or going to see my friends or going out to a bar. \n\nHowever, YOU are selfish for wanting me to stay home and for all the businesses to shut down.

But this absurd message has spread like wildfire to women BY women and weak leftist men that the mysterious nature of nighttime somehow completely revokes their ability to walk alone at night. Maybe it annoys me so much because I would never commit a crime against another person regardless of gender. But the way these women speak about \"not going out at night\" it's like they think stepping outside at night will cause a criminal to spawn next to you like in a video game and start assaulting you. It's a mostly absurd message and it's purposefully an oppressive message to say that women aren't allowed to walk alone at night because they won't be safe.","94":"She was a field correspondent in a war zone. What do you think happens in a war zone? Do you think its puppies and flowers? No, of course not. It's bullets, mortars, and bombs. It's death and maiming.

She knew this was a possibility when going to a war zone. So if you are to blame anyone, blame the war.\n\nNow, why does this war exist? It exists because Palestinians and Arabs in the Middle East are ethno-nationalists who believe non-Muslims living in the Middle East should be killed - kind of like a Blood-and-Soil type thing.

This is why they hate Israel, even though Israel has offered three times for Palestinians to become Israeli, the only nation in the Middle East with freedom and a GDP per capita higher than the United Kingdom.","95":"When Americans and people in the West think of Greece, they tend to group it with other Southern European nations at its latitude: Spain, Portugal, and Italy. Some people even reach further and group it with Turkey, Armenia, and the countries to its east.\n\nBoth of these are inaccurate. The countries that Greece is actually most similar to are Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania, Romania, and Serbia, aka the rest of the Balkans. \n\nGreek food, music, folk culture, architecture, and religion are shared with the nations to their immediate north, and while you can find similarities to other Southern European or even to some Near Eastern nations, you can find the same in other Balkan nations also. Any similarity you find between Greece and Turkey\/Armenia can also be found with Bulgaria and Albania, whereas the reverse is not true.\n\nNot all of Greece is Mykonos and Santorini. If you went to Thessaloniki or to Ioannina, you would be very surprised. These cities do not feel Southern European or Mediterranean, they feel Balkan. You will not see whitewashed buildings and feel the warmth of the Mediterranean sun... you will feel no different than if you were in Bulgaria or Serbia.\n\nPeople focus on the influence Greece had on Rome and on the Near East, but what about the influence it had on Eastern Europe? The Cyrillic alphabet originated within the borders of modern day Greece, and was based on the Greek alphabet. The Eastern Orthodox faith spread to the Slavic world from Greece.

Not having a tattoo is the new having a tattoo. You think you're so unique by having a tattoo. In the UK 1 in 3 young adults has a tattoo. Yeah you're so unique just like everyone else. Having a tattoo is like wearing the same uniform everyday. So unique.\n\nTattoo parlors are littered with pre-drawn designs so what most people get doesn't even have an ounce of originality to begin with, permanently scaring yourself to stand out from the crowd by adding yourself to a large pool of people with identical tattoos to yourself. The irony of branding yourself like the rest of the cattle then claiming to be unique. Lets face it, tattoos are for stupid people.\n\nAs Theodore Dalrymple writes ''There are many things that I don't understand, for example why intelligent people would want a tattoo''. One of MTV's finest excrement's is a show called \"Just tattoo of us\". Hosted by Charlotte Crosby, a woman famous for having sex on tv and getting her vagina out at every available opportunity and Steven Bear, a man so devoid of intelligence that MRI scans would have trouble picking up brain wave activity. The premise of the show is that people get tattoos designed by their friends with no input of their own. This leads to some permanent passive aggressive tats. Such as one girl got slut tattooed on her 19 year old cousin because she slept with 4 of her boyfriend's friends. Again tattoos are for stupid people. A highlight of the show is when Charlotte Crosby gets a tattoo of a half bear\/half cheetah on her back from Steven Bear as a reminder that she cheated on her ex boyfriend with him. She then proceeds to try to assault him.It's like watching prehistoric homo-genus discover tattoo guns instead of fire. Again tattoos are for stupid people.\n\nWith most relationships now lasting shorter than a goldfish's attention span, tattoo regret is now a growing problem. So many people regret getting shoddily done work that there is now an entire TV show dedicated to covering up bad tattoos.

But the map isn't the territory. Therefore the climate is not 'real' (and it cannot be), it is only a (statistical) model of reality.","100":"[deleted]","101":"I have always been pro-choice on the basis that I feel it is wrong to force a woman to continue to be pregnant against her will, intuitively it just feels wrong. I still consider myself \"pro-choice\" even know. But when I am forced to reckon with abortion by actually analyzing pro-choice arguments and their implications, I find it increasingly difficult to defend them (except for cases of rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother) and now feel morally conflicted.\n\n**The \"it is women making choices about their own body\" argument:**\n\nA woman choosing to have an abortion is not just choosing something for her own body, but also for someone else's body: that of the fetus. Fetuses are not part of the women's body even before viability because they are a separate entity with a separate DNA profile, and are just as much a biological product of the father as the mother. \n\nA woman is technically choosing what to do with her own body, yes, in that she is choosing to no longer be pregnant if she does not want to be, but she is also choosing to end the life of another entity which is not part of her physical body. The fetus draws nutrients from the mother's body to develop and grow, but that doesn't make it part of her body. To argue that it is, is factually incorrect.\n\n**The \"a fetus is a parasite and thus it is acceptable to kill it\" argument:**\n\nA parasite is defined as an organism of one species that attaches itself to an organism of ***another species,*** with the intent of extracting resources for its own survival at the expense of the host. By definition, a fetus is not a parasite. The fetus did not \"attach itself\" to the mother, the fetus is present because the mother and the father engaged in sexual intercourse, for which the known outcome is pregnancy. To describe the fetus as a \"parasite\" akin to a tapeworm is to dehumanize it with the intent of justifying its death by implying it is less than human and an invasive species, and using this sort of language to describe humans of any stage of development is inhumane.\n\n**The \"fetuses are less developed and therefore less valuable than their mother\" argument:**\n\nThis is probably the most persuasive pro-abortion argument, but it has deeply eugenicist undertones.  Note that I said above that a woman should be prioritized over her fetus if the pregnancy is going to kill her, but this is not based on me assigning more moral value to the woman over the fetus, it is that if the mother dies, the vast majority of the time so will the fetus, whereas the reverse is not true, so saving the mother saves one life, while trying to save the fetus is more likely to result in two deaths.\n\nAny time we try to assess the worth and value of another person's life, of any stage of development, based on their characteristics or stage of development, we open the door to eugenics. If we try to imply a fetus is less worthy of life and thus can be killed because it is \"less developed\" or \"dependent on its mother\" then we no longer can clearly articulate why we cannot kill people who society deems as \"parasites\" or \"lesser than\": people who depend on machines for survival in the hospital, people who are disabled and do not provide any economic benefit to society and extract more resources from society than they contribute, the impoverished, people on welfare, people who are unintelligent, and so on. When you define the value of life in terms of development or ability to contribute to society, it has dangerous implications. There is a reason many people say they support abortion \"if the child will have Down syndrome\" or have a \"disability.\" \n\nWe do not have the right to decide which lives are more valuable than others and then suggest that those which are less valuable can be killed. \n\n**The \"banning abortion forces women to obtain illegal abortions\/women have no choice\/contraception is inaccessible\" argument:**\n\nNearly every single person on the face of this planet knows that having unprotected sex will result in pregnancy. I knew this when I was 10 years old. Even in schools where abstinence-only sex education is taught, people know that sex results in pregnancy. That a grown woman of sound mind would not know this is just something I refuse to believe. \n\nYes, there are instances where birth control or contraception can be sabotaged by a controlling partner, or birth control can fail, and this is one of the reasons that I continue to acknowledge that there will always be exceptions in which abortion should be accessible, but the argument that banning abortion forces women to have unsafe abortions in the majority of instances is to imply that women generally have NO control over whether they become pregnant which is blatantly false. This isn't a moral dilemma but a falsehood. \n\nThe argument that contraception is inaccessible is also false. Obtaining free or highly affordable condoms is not difficult. Birth control is usually covered by insurance. if a man and woman choose to not use these protective measures because \"condoms make sex less pleasurable\" or \"birth control throws off my body\" then you are making an active choice to risk a pregnancy occurring, and it is your fault if it does. Take responsibility for your outcomes. \n\n**The \"abortion is a women's rights issue\/racial justice issue, men can just walk away from parenthood and removing abortion makes the situation inequitable for women\" argument:**\n\nThere are many reasons why this is just false.\n\n1. Women can give their child up for adoption and are not forced to be a parent against their will. To state that removing abortion makes women forced to be mothers is just not true. \n2. Men cannot just legally walk away from parenthood if the woman chooses to give birth and raise the child. Men see their wages garnished, driver's licenses revoked or points put on their license akin to if they got into an at-fault accident, or can be sent to jail for refusing to pay child support. A woman can choose to absolve herself of all of this by having an abortion, but men do not have the same ability, so not only is a woman making a choice about someone else's body (the fetus) but the man's entire life trajectory. And before you say \"well maybe the man should not have stuck it in, he had his choice when he refused to have unprotected sex,\" so did the woman. Abortion doesn't give women equal rights, it gives them special privileges over at least two other people's lives.\n3. Abortion clinics have been disproportionately placed in low-income areas inhabited primarily by people of color, especially Black people. Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, is on record stating that the goal of Planned Parenthood was to eliminate the Black population by reducing its birth rates. Abortion has led to far more Black deaths than police brutality, slavery, and genocides combined. Abortion is a wealthy white woman's issue, and has harmed the Black community irreparably, and is the reason why despite the Black population having higher number of children per household, the Black population has remained stagnant at roughly 12-13% for decades. Abortion is racist.\n\n**The \"abortion enables women to have fulfilling sex lives on their own terms\" argument:** \n\nThis will make me sound like a 70 year old Christian conservative, but I do not feel that a culture that encourages promiscuity, depravity, and decadence is a good thing. Going home with strangers you met at a club or bar every weekend and having unprotected sex creates public health risks, including sexually transmitted infections, mental health issues, and is dangerous. You never know who you are going home with and what that person is capable of, and while it is not your fault if you are murdered or raped, a dangerous situation could occur that could be prevented if we did not live in a culture of hedonism. \n\nAbortion enables people to believe that they can make risky choices with no consequences, because there is always a way out. There IS NOT always a way out of every dangerous situation that can occur if you hook up indiscriminately with strangers. \n\nThe other part of this, is that the notion that women are all pro-choice and men are all pro-life is false. Most pro-life charities and organizations are run by women, and there are many, MANY instances where men try to force the woman into having an abortion she does not want to have because he does not want to be a father. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Abortion cannot be easily defended when you go through each pro-choice argument one by one and I am now forced to reconsider my stance.","102":"If you ask me, it just teaches girls to be complacent in their role and not question their place.

But the point today isn\u2019t to say \u201coh they\u2019re wrong because the US is great\u201d. My point is different. indexes are inherently flawed because they cannot account for different situations that exist in every country.\n\nI got into a discussion recently with someone who tried to use these said indexes to compare the US to Norway: a country that frequently ends up at the tops of these lists, along with the other Scandinavian countries. Two of the arguments this user brought up were \u201cgovernment represents people better in Norway than the US\u201d and \u201cNorway currently doesn\u2019t have the racial issues the US does\u201d. And in said index, points got taken off for the US in such.\n\nI won\u2019t deny that Norway has fewer racial issues, and probably has government that represents its people better than the US, HOWEVER, it\u2019s important to note that Norway is a country with not even 6 million people, and a 93% white population (83.2% of the population being native Norwegians), while the US has over 330 million people, and is far, far racially diverse in its racial makeup, and culturally.\n\nSo yeah, no shit Norway is going to have far fewer racial issues or better representation. Because they don\u2019t have to represent nearly as broadly, nor do they have as nearly as size able racial minority population. \n\nA country like (but not limited to) the US will, not by any fault of its own, be taken points off for this.

A statement of opinion is not defamatory, nor is a statement that's an evaluation of publicly available fact. So when people say \"Kyle is a murderer\", what are they saying? They're saying that what Kyle did that night in Kenosha fits the definition of murder. They can be referring to the legal definition or some other definition and it's still not defamatory. Just because he was found not guilty doesn't mean he's not a murderer and doesn't mean that you can't call him a murderer. Being found not guilty just means that the government failed to prove he committed the act beyond a reasonable doubt. That failure doesn't constrain anyone's free speech. That's why we can all call OJ Simpson a murderer despite his acquittal and why PETA can call all meat eaters murderers even though that's not the legal definition of murder.\n\n2. \"Kyle is a white supremacist\"\n\nThis is a statement about Kyle's state of mind, his thoughts and beliefs. It's impossible to prove what he thinks or believes, and so any statements about state of mind are really just opinions. People have different definitions of what a white supremacist is, and they have different beliefs about what they think Kyle thinks. It's not defamatory to use a different definition and to state your beliefs.\n\n3. \"Kyle crossed state lines with a gun\" or other specific factual claims\n\nThis is the category of claims that might actually qualify as defamatory because they are actual factual statements. The problem is, Kyle is at least a limited purpose public figure. This means that for statements to be defamatory, they have to be made with actual malice, meaning they have to be statements known to be false or known with high probability to be false. So you'd need to prove anyone repeating this claim knew it was false at the time. That's hard to prove, especially since so many people were saying it. \"I heard this other outlet say it and I thought it was true\" would be a reasonable defense against a defamation suit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRittenhouse just wants fame and quick money. Fighting a lawsuit in court is expensive, so media orgs that know they'd win in court will still settle if they know it's still saving money overall.

If you look at the comments during a livestream or one of his YouTube videos you will see virtually all of them have a female name and often with a picture of a young female.\n\n**TLDR: Ethan Klein changed his political views from independent to far-left to appeal to young females so that they would buy his Teddy Fresh clothes.**","109":"I know Reddit has a hard on for Ukraine so first off I just want to say - I\u2019m not pro Russia, I\u2019m neutral on the matter.

I\u2019ve never seen such obvious propaganda IN MY LIFE!","110":"[removed]","111":"  \n\nI think that the famous rapper Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, better known as Snoop Dogg, should run as a Democrat for President of the United States. I am not joking. I think that if he did so, it would totally change the political landscape for the better. This is going to be a bit long but, if you stick with me for the next few paragraphs, I will explain why I believe this. \n\n**1.** **The Democrats have an education problem:**\n\nWhy don\u2019t the Democrats dominate American politics? Why was the last election, which took place during the biggest pandemic in a century, so close? How the hell did the Democrats lose to Trump in 2016? Why do they [seem set to lose again](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/2021\/11\/16\/democrats-are-course-lose-2022-2024-if-they-do-we-may-lose-our-democracy\/)? \n\nThere are a bunch of theories, but I believe it is because the Democrats have become overly focused on college educated voters. I\u2019m not the first one to point this out. This classic article appeared in [*Vox* in 2016](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2016\/4\/21\/11451378\/smug-american-liberalism) and here\u2019s one that came out in *The New York Times* [last month](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/10\/08\/opinion\/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html) and another one from this month in [the same publication](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/11\/04\/opinion\/democrats-culture-wars.html). If you don\u2019t want to read all that, I can sum it up for you, the Democrats\u2019 style and rhetoric is geared toward people who have at least a four-year degree. \n\nBut here\u2019s the problem[, most Americans do not](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States#\/media\/File:Map_of_states_percentage_of_population_with_Bachelor's_Degree_or_Higher_in_2009.svg). And this is increasingly creating a class divide in the country where two-thirds of voters feel like they are being talked down to and scolded by a party that wants their votes. This is an insane way to try to win elections and it needs to stop. \n\nI have news for Democrats, they can take the support of college educated voters for granted. As long as the Republicans continue their decent into increasingly insane ideologies such as, climate change denial, anti-vaxxing and even Qanon, you can be sure that the educated class will not vote Republican. So, the task at hand is to get the votes of people without college degrees. \n\n**2.** **Enter Snoop Dogg:**\n\nSnoop would be the perfect vessel to usher in an era of progressive dominance in the United States. To start with nearly everyone knows who he is. The median age [for American voters in early 40s](https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/policy\/docs\/ssb\/v64n2\/v64n2p57.pdf), which means that the average voter was in high school when Dr. Dre released *The Chronic* and propelled Snoop to superstardom. He is an incredibly charismatic person, and he holds a lot of progressive ideals ([check out his Wikipedia page](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Snoop_Dogg)). But, unlike the vast majority of Democratic politicians, he uses language that is accessible to non-college educated people. \n\nObviously, he has a lot of baggage:  he has been arrested numerous times, he admits that was a literal pimp for some time, he has a history of chronic (pun intended) marijuana use and his early music is rife with misogyny, homophobia and glorification of violence. \n\nBut\u2026stick with me, I think that all of these minuses can be turned into pluses. To start with, it makes him very relatable. Far more people without college degrees have had run ins with the law than those with university education. Also, for those of us who remember the 90s, you know that misogynistic and homophobic language were somewhat common during that time. This does not make it right, but I think most of the people who lived through that era also can look back with shame at some of the things that we said. So, again, we can find a reflection of our human flaws and or eventual progress in Snoop. And that feels good. \n\nHe'll probably have to stop smoking weed in order to run for president but, legalization of marijuana is a political winner. Most Americans have used marijuana and will not fault him for his past usage. He\u2019ll absolutely need to earnestly apologize for the pimping. That\u2019s pretty bad. \n\n**3.** **Snoop gets attacked from all sides**\n\nHere comes the best part. If Snoop were to announce a presidential candidacy it would infuriate a lot of people and that is exactly what we need. To start with, a lot of super-smart people would decry the state of democracy and write super-smart editorials in super-smart publications like *The New Yorker* and *The Washington Post*, just as they did when Trump announced in 2015. And how do you think that is going to look to the non-college educated voters? How effective were such attacks on Trump\u2019s candidacy?\n\nRight, so we have them out of the way, who\u2019s next? Likely the woke Twitterati will go after him for the aforementioned sexism and homophobia of his early work. Snoop can say, \u201clook, I said a lot of bad stuff in the past, and I\u2019m sorry, but we need to look forward and start getting this country back on the right track and not get stuck picking on people for what they said twenty or thirty years ago\u201d. I\u2019m sure he can come up with a much better way of saying that because he\u2019s way cooler than I am but that is a very popular sentiment in this country and it\u2019s what millions of people want to hear. It would drive Republicans nuts because their whole strategy is to portray the Dems as woke college kids who are out of touch with the average American. Even now they get scared when liberal media figures attack \u201ccancel culture\u201d. Why else would a leading conservative publication have been inspired [to write this](https:\/\/spectatorworld.com\/topic\/bill-maher-not-conservatives-side\/)?\n\nFinally, we have the racists to deal with. This is the easiest of all. The GOP is getting pretty good and racist dog whistling, but this would totally throw them off their game. So, let them hurl their hateful rhetoric at Snoop and see what happens. It will totally turn off black and Latinx voters, groups that [Trump actually picked up votes from in 2020](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-54972389). Also, the Republican love to paint Dems and wimpy crybabies who are totally out of touch with \u201ccommon people\u201d and to be fair, the Dems kind of play the part, but just let them try that with Snoop\u2026\n\n**4.** **Snoop wins in a landslide**\n\nHaving withstood attacks from the chattering elites of media and Washington, from the \u201cwoke\u201d snowflakes and from the alt-right Nazis, Snoop has more broad support than any politician since Roosevelt. I\u2019m not making this up. This is what Americans want and this is what America needs. [Have a look at this study](https:\/\/hiddentribes.us\/) which shows that most people are super turned off by activists on both the right and the left. Someone who has demonstrated a refusal to be cowed by those groups would be incredibly popular. \n\nMoreover, Snoop\u2019s fame and charisma would likely bring out millions of poor voters and young voters who are historically difficult to turn out at the polls as they feel disaffected by politics and politicians. Snoop\u2019s campaign would be incredibly empowering to the most marginalized groups in the United States. This is a campaign that would work. \n\n**5.** **The Dogg Administration:** \n\nOK, will probably have to start calling him Calvin Broadus but that was fun to write. \n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of people are going to say, \u201cSnoop Dogg is completely unqualified for the office of President of the United States\u201d. To which I might ask, \u201cAnd Donald Trump was?\u201d To which someone may counter, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s presidency was an utter disaster\u201d and I would then say, \u201cyes, but Donald Trump is insane, and Snoop is not.\u201d \n\nI concede, he would need a lot of help and he would need to read up on the issues. But, that\u2019s true for all presidents. There are plenty of people who would be more than happy to advise him on tax codes, national debt, foreign policy and the like. And I think he\u2019s got the brains to make the right choices. \n\nFinally, we have one elephant in the room. Does Snoop want to do this? I think he could be persuaded. If anyone who has read this far knows him, please show it to him! \n\nChange my view, people! I\u2019m worried that the Dems are about to get clobbered in 2022 and 2024 and I\u2019m pretty convinced that this can work. I\u2019m more than ready to entertain other ideas, however.","112":"It's unfortunate how you see nobody mentioning the stupidity with copypastas, only people that dick ride them.

For they are envious of whoremongers because they are delighted with sexual pleasure while they are not capable of attracting any women due either to their awkwardness or their poverty.\n\nBut the wise man is neither of these!

I honestly feel sadness for how many lost people are on here and it\u2019s not their fault. Our society has failed them in turning away from God. Men have become filled with rage and violence and woman have become filled with resentment and emotional abuse. I see daily, post after post of people needing advice for a range of things and the most popular comments normally tell them not to worry about anyone else but themselves. This is such bad advice. They become too self obsessed and self righteous that they start going down a lonely and dark path which leads to more time spent on the internet where they can just feed off pointless echo chambers instead of challenging ideas and growing in a healthy way.","123":"Before I say what I am about to say, I am 100% pro-choice. I support abortion, and the broader concept of bodily autonomy. I very much believe in \"my body, my choice.\" So this is NOT a debate about abortion.\n\nMy issue is with the fact that [Norma McCorvey (aka Roe)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Norma_McCorvey) changed her stance on abortion on more than one occasion. After the ruling was passed, she \"found religion\" and became an anti-abortion activist, supporting politicians who were against abortion, and regretted her role in the decision to legalize abortion. She said that she was being used as a pawn for abortion activists. But then later, on her deathbed, she changed her stance again and said that her conversion to Christianity was financially motivated and that she had been paid to speak against abortion.\n\nShe went back and forth on a number of other things too, as you will see in the above link.\n\nI feel that if she had remained a strong advocate for abortion throughout her life, she would be remembered as an activist who fought for women's rights. But instead she's known as \"Roe\", which is basically similar to \"Jane Doe\". People who are against abortion have plenty of things they could use as leverage. They could easily argue that Roe changing her stance on abortion and converting to Christianity is proof that she didn't really believe in abortion, and would have been happy if the ruling was overturned, or that she was mentally unstable and didn't know what she really wanted, since she kept changing her mind about various things.\n\nSo yes. Like I said earlier, I am pro-choice and do not want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned. But if it is, there needs to be a new advocate. A new voice who people would remember the same way we remember folks like Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony. I know there are things that people can use as leverage against them, but they are not John\/Jane Does. Most people know who they are without having to look them up. That's not the case with Norma McCorvey; I hadn't heard of her until I researched the history of Roe vs. Wade. I just knew her as \"Roe\".","124":"Apricot seeds are sold in my country in alternative health stores (the same stores that sell magical healing stones).

So--unless most guys have a low libido--for a child free male, getting into a monogamous relationship is against their best sexual interest.\n\nI realize sex isn't the be-all and end-all for a relationship. It's just a significant part. So for guys who do not have children and do not want children, getting into a strictly monogamous relationship will eventually screw them over.\n\nThis may not be an unpopular opinion, but I'm also of the belief that most people would cheat under the right circumstances and with a near impossibility of being found out. I have never wanted to nor been in such a circumstance, but I think it could happen to nearly anyone (besides perhaps certain Muslims or Roman Catholics who would risk death rather than do anything near cheating). \n\nAnyway, this belief supports my opinion that a monogamous relationship is bad because *if* either person does sleep with other people, it's more likely they'll keep it a secret. Non-monogamous relationships usually have that kind of stuff open and freely communicated.","131":"Just to clarify, this is a non-political post and I would like to politely ask commenters **to not involve politics in this topic.** \n\nI see plenty of posts by women in late 20s' and 30s' who constantly worry about finding a partner to have a child with. \n\nOf course, if they truly want that and it's an informed choice (based on more than societal expectations and fear of not being loved if they don't 'give' a man a child), then they should pursue what brings them happiness. \n\nSadly, often women are pressured and 'rushed' into something they may not even want, because of these two main factors: \n\n\n\n\n1. Ingraining in women's brain from an early childhood that becoming a mother is just what they'll do one day.\n\nIn more detail: Gendered toys, especially baby dolls, glorification and misrepresentation of motherhood in media and fiction, language used towards girls\/young women like 'when you're going to be a mother...' and more subtle clues that this is exactly women's destiny, without allowing them having an agency over this matter. Basically, taking from us an opportunity to think critically when it comes to childbearing.\n\n\n\n\n2. Men valuing women's ability to reproduce above anything else that makes them a human being. Luckily, not all men.\n\nIn more detail. Women have been convinced that love between them and a man can happen only with an addition of a child, with the majority of men excluding any other option than biological fatherhood. For most, infertility seems to be a dealbreaker, and in some countries it's even a valid reason for a quick divorce or an annulation of a marriage. This is utterly sad because it tells us that women are not worth anything as humans and have no other value in the society.\n\n\n\n\nMy thoughts on this were around for a while, but I decided to post on reddit after hearing from one of the closest friend that he would break a long-term relationship with a woman he claims he loves, if it turned out she can't bear children, which means he prioritised hypothetical, non-existing beings over a person who thinks, loves and has emotions.\n\n\nTo sum up, this obsession around becoming a mother\/father as a must, harms women who don't have partners yet and are afraid that their time is running out and they will never experience love if they miss their fertility years.\n\n\n\n**If you're comfortable with it, please specify your age and gender in brackets.**","132":"I'm sick of people saying that voices aren't inherently sexual, they are. The pitch of one's voice is a secondary sex characteristic, secondary sex characteristics are an evolutionary benefit that makes mates see you as more attractive and gives you an advantage for mating. The pitches of our voices develop during puberty, puberty produces sexually mature adults capable of mating.\n\nPeople will say that voices exist to talk to babies as if reproduction itself isn't inherently sexual. I also want to say this isn't an argument against talking in public, just people who delude themselves into thinking vooces aren't inherently sexual.","133":"There's an inherent contradiction in having a job that requires you to enforce laws, some of them unjust, while also being responsible for helping people in need, and then go going and stop a riot. In ancient Rome, they had different jobs for these tasks. \n\nThey had some public servants that put down riots, some that settled disputes between people, and everyone wasn't a massive pussy back then so they could defend themselves against school shooters. Just think about how weird it is that a person is tasked with beating down a protester at an anti-gun riot because they were out of line, then the next day the same person has to go to the suburbs and decide if it's indecent that some woman is doing gardening without panties, at which point they get a call that some kid is stuck on a roof on a farm he climbed up on because he shot a bull in the testicles with his bb-gun and the bull is very angry (all of these stories are real things that have fallen onto cops to solve).","134":"One of the arguments for vegetarianism is to reduce the  suffering of animals, based upon the principle that less suffering is better.  However, I'm not sure if most vegetarians know that there is an equivalent principle for human beings, called the non-aggression principle (or sometimes the harm principles).\n\nIn a nutshell, it says that the only ethical laws are laws that prevent people from harming or stealing from each other, because anything else constitutes aggression.  For example, the libertarian party has this in their platform:\n\n> Criminal laws should be limited in their application to violations of the rights of others through force or fraud, or to deliberate actions that place others involuntarily at significant risk of harm. Therefore, we favor the repeal of all laws creating \u201ccrimes\u201d without victims \n\nAnd while I am not a 100% libertarian myself, I do read libertarian publications like Reason, and one thing I've always seen that they do an excellent job of holding government accountable for the harm it causes, regardless of whom is in charge.  I think you also have to respect a political philosophy that basically wants to leave you alone and let you do what you want.  \n\nOf course there is room for debate about how harm is defined, but as a principle it is difficult to argue with- libertarianism means less harm, less coercion, and less suffering.  To me it seems like something vegetarians should also support as its an extension of their principles.","135":"What even is Lichtenstein? Monaco?

The world is a beautiful place with many different peoples and cultures, and you can gain a lot by interfacing with people outside of the culture you grew up with. I know people will argue that \"yes, but that doesn't mean you have to date them\", but obviously the experiences you get are much richer the closer you are to someone.

It's the worst, most toxic thing in the world for FDS to call men 'scrotes' or 'low value men', but terms like 'foid' and rating women on a 1-10 scale are okay? They're two sides of the same coin.

Whether it's for self defense or just for sports and hunting. \n\nI'm from the Netherlands myself and I've been practicing sport shooting for over 10 years.

But there are countries like Switzerland where a significant portion of the population owns a gun. Yet non of these countries are experiencing the issues the United States is facing today. \n\nSo I would say that the issue isn't with the guns itself, it's with the people using them.

There are just some people who can't be bothered with that shit; they don't want to hear about it because it's not affecting them in any way.\n\nI can only think of a few scenarios where I think interrupting television programs for news coverage is absolutely necessary:\n\n* If the country is under attack\n* If there's any sort of big incident in the area where you live that you might actually be affected by\n* If there's a natural disaster such as a tornado that you should be preparing for; and again, only if it's something that you and the people in your area would be affected by\n\nThe rest of the news coverage can wait until the regularly scheduled news program, or else broadcast on a separate channel with 24-hour news coverage.

I met different type of employers, luckily mainly reasonable ones, but one type always annoy me the most. Below, I'll give an example (this is UK if that matters).\n\nI was interviewed for a low\/medium position in a large, reputable institution. The job required a degree and experience in certain area and my interview went extraordinarily well. At some point I was confident I'll get the position. It was full time, 35 hrs per week, office-based role but considering the duties it could be easily done remotely and hours could be made flexible. I'll also add it was quite low paid.\n\nI had no problem with any of it, but I asked if I could finish two hours earlier once a week for educational reasons, and simply make up those hours by adding additional 0.5 hour to the rest of the days. I have about 8 years of experience and in the majority of places no one would care for something that insignificant.\n\nThe employer suddenly changed the tone from super welcoming, respectful and happy to annoyed and somehow agitated. I sat in silence listening to the panel and learning e.g. that I clearly didn't even read the job description properly because it's a full time job and there is absolutely no room for any flexibility! \n\nAt that point I knew there's no point trying to convince them\/try for this job anymore but... they kept ranting! I finally left with WTF smile, thank them and left with relieve, knowing I won't see that place at least for the next few years.\n\nThat's just one of the examples.

Axioms aren't absolute.

Lots of girls, feminists and misandrists in media and online would probably think otherwise. Their arguments are usually that since they are men they can't talk about women's issues or that it's their body and their choice, \"My body, my choice.\". But those arguments are pretty stupid and can be ripped apart. \n\nFirstly, \"men can't have a say in women's issues.\" Most women issues are related to men doing something that harms women, as in something sexist. So if men stopped getting involved in women's issues, we would have practically no issues in the first place. This also makes no sense, because if issues are being caused by sexist men, and you don't want other men to get involved that won't help. Because those sexist men are more likely to listen to another guy instead of a women. If I hate all people with red hair, and red-haired people start advocating against it, and someone who isn't a redhead tries to talk me out of hating on redheads I would be more inclined to listen. Because A, they are someone like me, and B they aren't a redhead. So to deny non-sexist men a chance to talk in this is simple stupid. \n\nAnother point I can make to this is, just because someone isn't apart of a community doesn't mean they can't have good opinions on it. \n\nAnd something that is also common is these girls bashing anyone who disagrees, by a lot. If you have an opinion remotely or even slighty different you're a \"bigot\", \"incel\" and \"women hater\". Even if you have good reason or don't force your opinion on others. \n\nSecondly, \"My body, my choice\". Everyone should have the ability to make their own choices in life but some choices just don't work out in good ways or have negative consequences. And yes, freedom of choice but not freedom of judgement or consequence. \"My body, my choice\" doesn't apply to all situations. For example, if I kill someone but I don't want to go to jail. Thats me as in my body, choosing not to go to jail. However you can't do that, and you wouldn't argue that I should have the right to do that, wouldn't you? If someone is slicing their wrist, mentally ill and gets dragged into a mental hospital, you wouldn't go and say, \"their body, their choice!\". (But I know some of yall weirdos prob would) \n\nThirdly, why exactly should men have a say on abortion? Well all of my previous writing answers this question. But abortion also affects and involves men in someway. The man is part of the reason the baby exist, meaning the have a direct say in matters related to it. It takes two to tango, the women and the man. What if the man wants the baby and the girl doesn't? Should he just have so sit there and do nothing even though that's also his baby? I think abortion should be 50\/50 meaning both parents get a say and work things out. \n\nI don't know how to solve the issue if the man wants it and the girl doesn't. But I believe the man has the right to discuss his view on it.","167":"Somebody let their cat out and it got hurt? Their fault.

I can outrun a person with a knife and keep my distance from them, but I can't outrun bullets. \n\n2.) Bullets can go through walls and kill people, but a knife can't. Even your own house can't protect you from bullets most of the time.\n\n3.) Gunshot wounds are generally more deadly than stab wounds, because bullets hit with enough force to blow apart flesh, and they can also break apart inside the body, causing further damage.\n\n4.) Guns can kill multiple people A LOT faster and easier than a knife.\n\n5.) For law enforcement, dealing with a suspect that has a semi-automatic firearm, is far more difficult and dangerous for them than dealing with a knife wielder. \n\n6.) There are lots of stab-resistant clothing around, they're easier to make from scratch, and they're pretty effective. \n\nReason for bombings:\n\n1.) Most people either don't want to go through the trouble of creating and preparing a bomb, or they aren't smart enough to even make it in the first place. They are more difficult to use, and less easily accessible than a gun. This would probably explain why they aren't used as often as guns.\n\nSo yes, while killers will try to find many other ways to kill people, I'd rather deal with those, than deal with shootings.\n\n\n\n**\"But u\/Heinrich64, criminals will still find ways to get guns no matter what, won't they?\"**\n\nThe reason why they've been able to get guns in the first place, is due to stealing from guns stores & legal gun owners. No gun stores or legal gun owners = guns being far less likely to fall into the hands of criminals. \n\nAnd no, guns aren't smuggled into this country nearly as often as you may think. [Actually, it's quite the opposite.](https:\/\/news.harvard.edu\/gazette\/story\/2022\/02\/stopping-toxic-flow-of-gun-traffic-from-u-s-to-mexico\/) \n\n[The US is the reason why so many criminals in Latin American countries are getting their hands on powerful weapons.](https:\/\/www.economist.com\/the-americas\/2019\/05\/23\/guns-from-the-united-states-are-flooding-latin-america)\n\nAlso, many other countries have banned guns, and they don't have nearly as many shooting **MURDERS** as we do. And don't even think of mentioning their stabbing deaths, because we all know the death count would've been higher if the perps had guns, and my reasoning is explained in previous points. Stop comparing guns to knives. It's extremely dumb.\n\n\n\n**\"But what about my freedom?\"**\n\nIf your freedom to play around with an overpowered weapon is more important than someone's life, then that means you're the kind of person that doesn't deserve a gun. If you're not willing to give up a weapon when you're legally required to do so, then that also means you're the kind of person that doesn't deserve a gun. \n\nIt is of my opinion that those who are willing to give up their power for the sake of others, are the ones who truly deserve the freedom to wield it. I personally don't trust people who aren't willing to give up their power for the benefit of society, or when they are legally required to do so; you're basically admitting that you're a potential violent criminal. And don't even try to question whether or not the civilian populace would be better off without guns, 'cause you know damn well it would be, as lots of innocent people would still be alive today, if it was extremely hard, or impossible, to get them. \n\n\n\n**\"But u\/Heinrich64, how the fuck am I supposed to defend myself or my property?\"**\n\nThere's pepper spray, tasers, self-defense knives, and even knife resistant clothing available. Hell, get a fucking axe, a machete, or even a fucking katana, and chop the bastard up, I don't care. If the perp doesn't have a gun, then you don't need one either. Just be prepared, be well equipped, know how to fight, and be good at running. You don't need to pretend like you're fucking Rambo. \n\nAlso, there's security systems, cameras, and window gates to help protect your house. And if the perp doesn't have a gun, at least he can't shoot through your house.\n\n\n\n**\"But what if they have a gun?\"**\n\nLike I said before, they wouldn't even have guns in the first place, if they weren't made available to the public. That's where they get most, or possibly, all of their guns. No guns available to the public means no guns on the streets. The Uvalde Shooter purchased his guns legally as soon as he turned 18. If there were no gun stores or gun owners around to steal or buy from, how difficult do you think it would've been to get them? If he had went into that school with just a knife, how many more kids do you think would've survived? \n\n\n\n**\"But what happens when the government tries to oppress us?\"**\n\nOk, let's take a look at what's happening in Ukraine right now.  Ukraine has relied, **heavily**, upon Western military equipment to keep Russian forces at bay. And no, it isn't just guns,  they've also sent Javelin anti-tank missiles, Stinger anti-aircraft, and Switchblade drones. Now, imagine if Ukraine didn't receive any military equipment from any nation at all. They would've been SOL, and they had their own military equipment! This basically proves that guns alone is not enough to even put up a fight against our current military, if they really wanted to fuck us over. What the fuck are your measly little guns gonna do against tanks, armored cars, and jets? This isn't the 1800s anymore, where all the militaries had were single-shot rifles and some cannons. Nowadays, they have all sorts of shit they can use to take you out, if they wanted to.\n\nAnd that's not all. You also have to account for the possibility of civilians fighting against you, in favor for the government! So basically, it doesn't matter if you have guns or not, you're fucked either way. And even if you somehow, by the grace of God, win this hypothetical civil war, you would still lose a shit ton of people, and the country will be in shambles afterwards. \n\n\n\nAnd lastly, I am not implying that guns are the only reason people keep being murdered here in the US. I'm well aware that our shitty culture and lack of support for the mentally ill are the other big things that lead to homicides. But don't sit up here and pretend like easy access to overpowered weapons hasn't played a part in anyone's death at all. You're just deluding yourself. I mean, for fucks sake, gunshots are common where I live. I don't feel safe in my own home, since a stray bullet can easily go through my house and kill my ass. Now, ask yourself, which would save me from being killed by a stray bullet: Having my own semi-automatic rifle, or the perp not having a gun in the first place?","169":"For those who followed the Jubileum parade there is no need to explain why.\n\nThis little boy was literally at his naughtiest, displaying an annoying show of authority against his embarrassed mother, Kate Middleton, while his siblings were having normal posture and behaviour.\n\nOf course, the commenters did not dare to interpret the kid's act as bad, they just said the \u201dPrince Louis stole the show\u201d or something.\n\nI am really glad he is not first in line for the British throne!\n\nFor those who didn't see him, here is a scene.","170":"as a movie buff who watches many movies in theaters and on streaming every year, one of the biggest nights of the year for me is the academy awards. i\\`ve been watching the full ceremony since 2018 and have watched every night since and one of my favorite categories of fun facts is oscar fun facts.\n\nhowever, whenever i talk about anything oscar related on reddit, i get people aggressively telling me about how the oscars suck and even questioning why i watch it. although its perfectly fine to not want to watch the oscars, i find people\\`s attitudes about me choosing to do so to be pretentious at best and douchebaggy at worst.\n\ni honestly fail to see how me choosing to watch the oscars affects you in anyway. if anyone is negatively affected by me watching the oscars, it\\`s me. that ceremony often runs very late into the night and i get tired very easily. just because i enjoy something doesn\\`t mean that i try to force it on other people. no one in my house is forced to watch the oscars with me. this is my thing and if other people choose to join me, they are welcome to. \n\nbesides, is it any surprise that a film buff likes to watch the oscars? a quick browse through my posting history will make it very apparent that i am a lover of the moving image. i have very strong opinions about movies and i enjoy good natured debate on the subject. as such, why is it such a surprise that i like to watch the oscars? and again, it has nothing to do with you. i can spend my sunday evenings however i please. if i choose to spend my sunday evening tap dancing on top of the empire state building while wearing a shark hat and yelling \"paprika\" over and over, i\\`ll do it. \n\ni don\\`t tell you how to live your life. please extend me the same courtesy.","171":"[removed]","172":"[removed]","173":"The smallest things trigger liberals.\n\nDid you know that you've sat next to a gun owner in public before and nothing happened?\n\nDid you know that kids can be taught to be colorblind way more easily than they can be taught to be \"anti-racist?\"\n\nDid you know that many of your male friends (lol, acquaintances more like it) have been thoroughly emasculated by liberal society and they know that you'll judge them if they show any sign of desiring to fulfill a traditionally-masculine role in society, so they don't tell you?\n\nDid you know that immigration and culture mixing is literally the basis of the collapse of American society?\n\nAs a liberal, you probably know all these things intellectually, but your emotions get the best of you and you lash out.

Rappers and artists in these genres for years have been allowed to get away with the most despicable and disgusting comments and lyrics directed towards gay people, all the while being praised and showered with awards, record deals and positive publicity, even from those who acted as though they cared about gay rights and against homophobia.\n\nHowever, in recent years, we have been seeing a wave of new gay rappers who have taken the rap and hip-hop communities by storm... such as Lil Nas X and Tyler the Creator, amongst others. Yet, this new brand of gay-positive rappers has created significant anger among many of the still-largely homophobic community. In an interview, Lil Nas X says:\n\n> \"The honest truth is, I don\u2019t want to speak on a lot of the homophobia within rap because I feel like this is a very dangerous playing field... It\u2019s more for my own safety rather than anything else\" [[source](https:\/\/www.billboard.com\/music\/rb-hip-hop\/lil-nas-x-talks-homophobia-rap-safety-9613308\/)].\n\n...so, even despite his success, Lil Nas X still finds himself in danger from the entrenched homophobe mainstream of the rap world. Even from the progressive voices of America, only small amounts of condemnation is ever levied against this overwhelming anti-gay hate. Even the rapper Da Baby, who received some criticism for his recent homophobic remarks in 2021, continues to put out records and songs on major labels with significant positive attention and success.\n\nAs such, it is clear that a reckoning in the hip-hop and rap communities needs to occur to eliminate this entrenched homophobic majority within their ranks, so, I am very excited to see the increased queering of rap and hip-hop with new gay artists. If anything, I hope and very much advocate for a new army of gay rappers come to dominate the genre and push out the hate-filled homophobic rappers. I want to hear new songs from rappers about their gay experience, about their gay love, about promoting gayness in the hip-hop world, and making rap more queer. Furthermore, once they take over, I hope that all homophobic rappers and their songs are purged and eliminated, their record contracts canceled, their music removed from platforms, because this would seem to be the only way to cure homophobia within this community. I mean, come on, why are we still condoning homophobia from this group when it is not being tolerated in literally ANY OTHER domain? Anyone who still listens to homophobic rap and doesn't speak out against it is themselves either homophobic or are homophobia enablers.","185":"Us and Taiwan claim Taiwan as independent, China claims it as theirs.

You thought people were going to become more charitable, generous, welcoming anf that it was going to become this euphoric paradise? Quite the opposite, when you liberate people from their moral and societal constraints, people are naturally going to become more selfish, greedy, self-centered, more unconcerned with the greater of society, vain, perverted, power-hungry, materialistic and very shallow\n\nWhy would in a socially liberated society would people want to do what's greater for the community when there's no moral obligation to do so anymore?

The central question was whether an Op-Ed that referred to Depp\u2019s abuse without actually including his name represented malicious defamation.  In Depp\u2019s own words he did abuse Heard so she can\u2019t possibly defame him by referring to the same, and the fact that studios continued to sever ties with him as he was imploding his own career through dangerous and unprofessional behavior can hardly be said to be under her control.\n\nFor whatever reason the above recording was not included in the trial but ample evidence was provided with multiple witnesses corroborating that Depp was indeed physically abusive.  Instead dangerous victim blaming stereotypes were reinforced, she was grilled for not seeking medical attention, pressing criminal charges or flawlessly documenting every instance of his abuse with photos and videos.   Even though it is well documented that a large portion of abuse survivors do none of the above.\n\nHeard was unsympathetic to a jury, most likely lied about or distorted some details  and participated in reactive abuse but none of that negates the fact that she was an abuse survivor as she stated in the Op-Ed.

And so the work to address injustice wherever it exists remains the work ahead,\" she said.\n\nSo did the administration put in the work?  Here's a headline nine months later.

And while you might think this is happening in \"MAGA country\" or whatever, the cities with the biggest rise in AAPI hate crimes are Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. \n\nAs Asians are dealing with concerns about their own safety, they are also seeing academic opportunities closed off to them, and the people they counted on to defend their civil rights turning their back on them.

But what I am referring to goes beyond that and seems more about trying to put down the U.S. and Americans than simply comparing.\n\nIt's a very childish kind of behavior that is all too common in international news. Many people in other countries cover unimportant US news to show how much better off they are, then they have the audacity to call Americans self-centered and ignorant.\n\nThe U.K. does this especially when it comes to things like health care and socio-economics. They cover a horror story in the US related to health insurance and than break to some comment about how blessed they are to have the NHS. Very transparent.\n\nAustralia and Canada do it too; In both countries there is a tremendous level of obsession over what and how the US does things. It usually turns into how they are \u2018better\u2019 than the US due to \"so and so factor\".\n\nWhen I was in Australia many years ago, I saw a report covering Obama throwing the opening pitch for Major League Baseball in the U.S., and it was so odd. How is this news in Australia (baseball's not even a popular sport over there). They really can't blame the U.S.\/Americans for their own obsession. They would have never given Japan, Mexico, France, Brazil, China, Italy, Germany, Russia, ect; that ype of inconsequential and mundane coverage.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t criticize the United States, but this type of fretting and comparing to boast \u2018superiority\u2019 just makes them look pathetic and full of themselves.\n\nThat is a big part of why I don't understand the criticism that Americans boast about their country being superior when it's largely a product of the international community's constant coverage of the US.

If you are only outraged because of the method of death, then you are just looking to be outraged. People need to be more level-headed and objective!

No they're not micro organisms that just happen to be alive. They HAVE A BRAIN. And they're in control of everything they do. They have thoughts. They make decisions. They have emotions. They even experience feelings of honour and guilt. \n\nUnless the owner directly ordered the dog to do the act, it's totally reasonable to blame the dog for it. And ONLY the dog. Not the owner. \n\nAlso abused dogs do not misbehave. They cower in fear and are perpetually scared. You don't know what mistreated dogs behave like.","232":"My position is NOT that the police are blameless. My position is that in an evolving, chaotic, precarious situation with conflicting reports and a constant stream of unreliable information leading decision making, we shouldn't be blaming individuals for the deaths of kids until we know what led them to make the choices they did. In addition, there is rampant misinformation going around about the nature of the police response.\n\nHere's what we know, [according to this timeline](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nation\/2022\/05\/26\/uvalde-school-shooting-timeline\/):\n\nAt 11:27, Ramos crashes his car into the school.\n\nAt 11:30, [according to this source,](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/05\/27\/us\/uvalde-texas-elementary-school-shooting-friday\/index.html) the first call to police is made.\n\nAt 11:31, [according to this source,](https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/timeline-shooting-texas-elementary-school-unfolded\/story?id=84966910), an ISD officer who heard the reports immediately speeds to the school and tries to engage the shooter, accidentally confronting a teacher instead.\n\nAt 11:33, Ramos enters the school and begins shooting.\n\n**At 11:35, two minutes later, three police enter the building to confront him and two are shot.** Four more arrive and **also** enter the building.\n\nFrom 11:37 to 11:44, the shooter fires rounds in intervals.\n\nAt 11:51, the police sergeant and additional officers arrived.\n\n**At 12:03, it is estimated as many as 19 local police officers may have been in the hall outside the classroom.**\n\nAt 12:10, the first federal agents arrive.\n\nAt 12:21, the shooter fires through the door and the police take positions further back in the hallway with federal agents.\n\nAt 12:50, the door to the classroom is opened using a key and the shooter is killed by a member of the Border Patrol.\n\nThere was never a time where Uvalde police completely left the building. There was never a time where they all retreated outside the school and waited for help from federal agents. I am not commenting whatsoever on how they treated parents, or the officers who went in to save their kids. I'm pointing out that numerous officers immediately engaged the shooter, multiple were shot, and they never abandoned the school. As time passes, only more officers enter the building.\n\nCould they have been cowardly? Absolutely. But the commanding officer who assessed the situation as no longer an active shooter and now a barricaded subject almost certainly did not do so out of cowardice. The shooter shot volleys of bullets through the door at officers and was firing infrequently. I can't say it's impossible to believe there's scenarios that lead a commanding officer to likely and reasonably believe there's no longer students being shot in the classroom.\n\nI certainly would not blame the individual Uvalde police officers, many of which charged in and were shot at and stayed regardless, who tried to burst through the door but couldn't while the shooter was firing through it. I will reserve that judgement until I know more details about the shooting, because the last thing I want to do is pile on with the rest of the internet to tell a bunch of first responders they're responsible for the death of kids when they risked their lives and were told to stand back on either bad commands or bad information. And I don't want to say the commanding officer was responsible when I have no idea what information he was using to make his judgement.\n\nI think it's terrible that anyone is forced to confront a situation where an active shooter more heavily armed than themselves is made accountable for any and all of their actions before anybody knows what really happened. It is always easy to pin the blame for Chernobyl on technicians who failed to follow procedure on a routine and normally innocuous safety check for the plants' meltdown. It is always easy to blame the physician who accidentally overdosed a patient because he read the chart wrong after twenty years on the job. It is always easy to pin the blame on the grandmother who accidentally ran over her grandchild because she didn't check her rearview camera backing out of the garage for the child's death. What all these scenarios essentially miss is the systemic issues that come into play with these tragedies, that human error will always be part of the system and that confronting individuals who made a mistake in a crucial situation is a lazy way to convince oneself if not for this *bad* or *incompetent* individual, these things wouldn't happen. Maybe we need redundant systems in nuclear reactors to ensure that meltdowns are less likely when low probability events predictably align. Maybe we need automated dosage for patients so that a sleepy doctor doesn't result in a death. Maybe we should make new cars detect objects behind them and alert the driver like many do now.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, we should reserve judgement on the action of officers in an active school shooting until we know more about it, and focus a bit more on the systems that lead to a situation where a botched police response means a dozen more children dead at the hands of a killer.","233":"This should not even be a conversation.

Now, it is met with calls of \u2018socialism\u2019, even though it is fundamentally an economically right-wing idea.\n\n\nAnother example that comes to mind is people refusing to call an ambulance even when grievously injured, rationing their insulin supplies against medical advice, and sometimes even crossing the border to avoid going bankrupt while obtaining basic medical services, because universal healthcare is \u2018communist\u2019.\n\n\nNote that I\u2019m not discounting the role of individualism.

Because every time a new President is elected, they basically undo everything the previous President did, only to have the next President restore it again. A recent example being Trump withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement only to have Biden re-instate it. The next President, if they are a Republican, will most likely withdraw the US from the agreement again.\n\nMy proposal: Rather than automatically holding a Presidential Election every four years, they should instead, during the primaries, have the people vote on whether or not the President is doing a good job and therefore should remain in office. If the majority of the people like the current President, they will stay in office for another four years; no need to hold an election. As long as the people keep voting for the President, they will remain in office; no term limits. If, on the other hand, the majority of the people \"vote the President out of the ~~tribe~~ White House\", the incumbent President will leave office on January 20 of the next year, and the newly-elected President will take office. The previous President will NOT be eligible to be re-elected at a later date.\n\nThe system would work similarly to a recall election (at least how it works in my state; not sure about other states), where the people would vote on whether or not the President should remain in office, and at the same time, vote for their preferred candidate in the primaries. If the majority of the people vote for the President to remain in office, that will be the end for another four years. However, if the majority of the people think the current President should NOT remain in office, then the election would proceed as it usually does when the incumbent President is not eligible to run again, with the Democratic and Republican candidates who recived the most votes in the primaries hold debates, the people will vote as usual in November, and the candidate with the most votes becomes the next President.\n\nOh, and they should eliminate the Electoral College too.","291":"[deleted]","292":"Don\u2019t get me wrong, MLK was a great speaker and movement leader, and his leadership of the Montgomery Bus Boycott and his March one Washington were fabulous and influential.\n\nBut on the other hand, LBJ was the one who pushed repeatedly to pass civil rights and who made maneuvers to convince the right people to support it and who signed the bills and who enforced civil rights laws.

It occurs to me that in the medical context if we are prepared to define 'death' or 'the end of life' as being linked to the ending of neural activity in the brain or cardiac activity in the heart then we should have a logical reason to accept that the 'beginning of life' should coincide with the beginning of cardiac activity in the heart and neurological activity in the brain. Both of which occur at some point prior to birth. \n\nPro-choicer argue that a women's ownership of her body gives her the right to abort a pregnancy. The way this is typically thought of is as a biological version of \"castle doctrine\". Under castle doctrine if someone is trespassing on your land you can legally kill them. For the pro-choicer it doesn't matter if the foetus is a life or a person. What matters is that women have the right to choose.\n\nIt occurs to me that this isn't a great argument. Just because you have the right to make a decision doesn't mean it is a morally good decision to make. I have the right to go up to a stranger on the street and tell them that their face is so ugly it makes me want to puke. If i say this I haven't violated their rights in anyway but I have still done something wrong. I think the pro-choice activist has to go further than merely proving that women have the right to abort pregnancy. They have to show that it is an ethical decision to make. \n\nI think the only way the pro-choicer can do this is to demonstrate that the foetus never constitutes \"a life\" or \"a person\". However the way we define death seems to indicate that these foetuses should count as 'alive' in the relevant sense. \n\nI still consider myself pro-choice because (1) I still believe in some biological version of castle doctrine - even if enacting it harms something that counts as a person, and (2) I reckon that we can perhaps think of \"life\" and \"death\" on more of a continuum. Even if we define the moment of death as the moment where neurological activity stops those who are approaching death seem to loose their personhood well before this arbitrary point. They also tend to loose their personhood gradually over a long period of time.

(CICO) and every body is the same.. the problem is, it seems like this is the popular opinion (or lie that's believed to be true)  \n\n\nYeah, lowering your caloric intake does make you lose weight, but these people take it to a levle where they say 1000 calories of fast food is the same for weight loss as 1000 calories of healhty food. because CICO.   \n\n\nThis also doesn't take into consideration that the nutrients eaten also affect what sort of processes your body does, which also use calories.. Without cholesterol and HDL's your body doesn't convert a lot of hormones, so that's energy you're not using. other nutrients are available immediately in a food source, and others are found via bioconverting, which is also taking up energy.  \n\n\nNor does this include any sort of thing such as certain people excrete food much faster than their body can absorb all the calories out of the food, or people with hypothyroidism which alone would telll you bodies are not the same.  \n\n\nSo it's still calories out, but they think it's \"Eat 1000 calories, run the same mile, and you'll have the same out come. Eat all that ice cream you want until 1000 calories everyday\"  \n\n\nthen they'll say anything against it is against the science or against thermodynamics.. like a missionary reading off a pamphlet.

Then they'll show you their Grateful Dead concert paraphernalia and offer to smoke you up.  They're decent folks, if a little dim due to over-medication.\n\nWhen Gen-X was growing up, we assumed we'd die in nuclear war (aka red skies at night), but it turned out the soviet union was the paper tiger, crumbling before we even left high school.  Our new world order had the US sending troops to a bunch of places like Panama, Mogadishu, Kuwait, and Bosnia that we could barely find on a map, but we never worried about socialists.\n\n9\/11 changed everything (kids ask your parents), and by the middle of the decade, it was pretty normal to hear about some guy try to blow up a plane with his shoe and then him and a few of his closest friends getting flown to Guantanamo to get waterboarded.  Since Islamic terrorists were pretty scary, we also had the comic relief terrorists, which were the Eco-terrorists.  For example there was one group called ELF who would burn down empty buildings (which would then be rebuilt).\n\nIn the midst of that, there were also the occasional anti-government terrorists, labeled as right-wing, like Tim McVeigh who blew up a Federal building with fertilizer.  (Redneck engineering champion. They rebuilt that building too - unfortunately it wasn't empty.)\n\n### Socialist Revolution = Hurricane Bob\n\nBut where were the socialists?  Well, we finally found out in the Trump years, when they figured out that a global pandemic was a good time to start a riot (since people are home doing nothing anyway).  There was rioting and looting in dozes of cities causing billions of dollars of damage - basically as much damage as Hurricane Bob,  (Kids, ask your parents --  actually don't bother they won't remember either.)\n\n(Note - I am giving credit to the socialists for the BLM\/Antifa riots because I saw the role that the DSA-LA played here in southern california, using reddit and twitter and their own website to organize, and based on the screenshots Andy Ngo posted in Portland that were similar.)\n\nI don't know how it was in other areas, but here in SoCal, the second that the national guard was called out, they folded like a cheap umbrella (which was incidentally their primary weaponry) and fled as fast as their skateboards could carry them.  And the working class that they claimed to represent was cheering the national guard, not them.\n\n### More capitalism, please.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that people wanted capitalism - they wanted to be able to go back to work and to school and to the mall and to their sportsball games etc etc, which is what happened and where we are now.  So while the socialist movements of the 60s were able to help end the war in Vietnam, this one accomplished absolutely nothing.\n\nAnd while I don't think the government took the socialists all that seriously, they did a little - calling out the national guard in many states, and then trump deployed federal troops to portland to protect buildings, which meant that antifa had someone there to fight every day.  When a big part of your identity is based around being the final nail in the coffin of capitalism, that has to be some decent validation after 20+ years.  At least they weren't being ignored any more.\n\nThat lasted all of six months, until the insurrection, when Trump and his supporters literally stormed the capital and killing everybody.  Okay, not really, but it was fun for the establishment left to pretend, and the NYT really did do its best, claiming a capitol police officer was killed.  Now of course we know a lot more, like a lot of the protestors were let into the capitol, the FBI and BLM were both in attendance, and the vast majority haven't been charged with anything much more than trespassing.\n\nAnd of course establishment Democrats are still beating the \"Republicans are dangerous\" drum for all its worth, investigating PTA moms and blaming mass shootings on Republicans because they read a 180 page manifesto by a self-described authoritarian leftist, hybrid nazi, and green nationalist, who hated conservatives and fox news, and and found something that Tucker Carlson said once.  And then, once again the socialist becomes \"the forgotten man\". \n\n###Why isn't anyone calling me an enemy combatant and taking me to Gitmo?  Don't I matter?\"\n\n\nSo yes, I believe socialists really miss Trump, because they had an enemy, and someone who would fight back against them, even if it was mostly him just treating them like spoiled children.  Because literally the worse thing that can happen to someone who claims to be not just fighting the establishment, but destined to win, is for the establishment to completely dismiss and ignore them.\n\n##BUT That's not real socialism\n\nYeah, I don't want to hear it.

This society does the stupidest shit.. \n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to see and comprehend that advocating for cigarettes is doing the complete opposite of advocating for freedom.. yet so many people conveniently don't grasp that part and pat themselves on the back for thinking \"free\".. when they aren't. \n\nAdvocating for freedom to become addicted to a government backed substance is the opposite of actually being free; you're literally advocating for more drones and robots to addiction. \n\nYou think you're going against the government by crying about them taking away or limiting cigarettes, yet you don't see you're doing the exact thing they want you to do. You think the government actually gives a fuck about prohibiting tobacco? If it didn't make them so much money for decades and generations, they would have by now. That's why it's commonly known that tobacco companies owners and workers have even stated they don't smoke themselves and that it's for the stupid people falling into their addictions and capitalism...\n\nThe government has supported tobacco companies for generations. They are getting paid by tobacco companies and this fact isn't new. Just like big pharma. The government WANTS people to smoke cigarettes so more people could become addicted. Just like big pharma. Everyone cries and complains about big pharma yet conveniently turn their nose at tobacco companies.. which are doing the exact damm thing. They're creating addicts because the more addicts they have, the more money they make; the tobacco companies AND the government. \n\nSo take a second to think and really comprehend what the fuck you're advocating for.. you aren't advocating for real freedom. Real freedom would be NOT being controlled and extorted by the government. You think holding a stupid paper saying how much you advocate tobacco is going against the government.. lol its not. You're doing their jobs for them. We should be advocating that the government actually does something about it; that would help the addiction, the money they extort from our health and it would make the country a better place.. but of course not. We never advocate for things that will better everybody as a whole because people are too damn selfish and ignorant. Its all about some make believe personal rights that literally do nothing but ruin families and lives.. how can you call yourself a decent person when you're advocating shit like that? \n\nNo decent person should advocate a drug, a substance, that literally controls you and that commonly often times destroys families to some capacity.

All for some delusioned bullshit freedom... it's like people really dont think nowadays \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nSo all in all, the basis of the post is; fuck all of these righteous advocates that half ass advocate for things they're either addicted to themselves or they have no clue what tf they're advocating. As an actual smoker, as a person that's watching what it's doing to my mom, and as a person that has seen multiple people quit... please stfu advocating for us. We don't need or want you advocating our delusioned rights and delusioned freedom. You're hurting the country and society more than you are helping anything. If you really want to advocate for freedom.. advocate for good health, advocate for getting out of addictions and control, advocate for the betterment of families and keeping families together, advocate for the countless of young kids that see their parents smoking and start smoking, advocate for all the lost children that have lost their parents and families due to smoking, advocate for everyone that has no money because they spend everything on their addictions, advocate for the clarity of mind, advocate for the strength to quit, the strength, power and knowledge to do better, advocate for the dismantling of the governments control, advocate for all the people affected by tobacco, advocate for enlightenment, advocate for positivity, advocate for healing, advocate for the TRUE freedom of choice to live without being bombarded by unhealthy lifestyles, advocate for logic... and quit advocating for this other bullshit, especially when you're just an outsider looking in.

And then they're upvoted for it. Why do people constantly think doing this is funny or cool? Why is actively annoying people so supported? \n\nIt just looks like a lack of individuality and a lack of respect tbh. And then it seems like half of the half of comments that do it are recycling something someone already commented like they couldn't even be bothered enough to actually read them before commenting themselves. Its like the only reason they went to the post was to make that comment, which just shows how hive mindey the place is if everyone is using the same jokes without even knowing. \n\nIf I read or hear that someone dislikes something (especially if they're a stranger and have no issues with them), I'm not going to go out of my way to annoy them with it? What does that do for me but just make me look like an asshole? But again that seems to be the culture that's supported on Reddit.. \n\n\"Oh they don't like it? Ima do it anyway!\" Like it just comes off entitled and privileged. I don't see many people or posts that talk about this so I decided to make one. I originally was going to make a post as to how yo momma jokes are overused and unfunny but then got to thinking let me address the main issue: the lack of originality and individuality in general. There's enough posts about yo momma jokes and every single one of them is bombarded with yo momma jokes. I don't know if it's a maturity issue (seems like there's a lot of immature people on here) or just a lack of respect and decency (which is also a maturity issue) but it does get annoying. \n\nBut it goes beyond this tho. Almost anything you say or post you're going to be bombarded with people trying to argue with you, or trying to nitpick something, or trying to \"call something out\", or just doing something. And I understand; its a public platform and people have their own opinions but people will waste all this time and energy going out of their way to discredit or argue with someone. They never once think \"hmm, maybe my opinion really isn't needed right now\" or \"well honestly I don't have much experience with said thing, maybe my two cents is irrelevant and unnecessary\". But no, majority of the time people feel compelled to have everything they think heard (I don't know if it's an ego issue, a privilege issue, a deflection that they aren't being heard in reality, or what). \n\nAnd people undoubtedly are going to say \"you're doing the same thing.. voicing your opinion\". Yeah I am voicing my opinion on my own post. But there's a difference between making a post to talk about things and simply going out of your way to a post you dislike to state your disapproval. I don't go to posts I dislike. If the post has a title I dislike; I probably won't open it. If I open a post and dislike it; I'm probably just moving on to a post I do like. Honestly I don't even really look at other posts on Reddit often but if I do I try to be respectful. I don't even remember the last time I've downvoted a post. People spend their whole day going around arguing and disliking posts. I don't care enough about your opinions to argue tbh and if I do, I'll specifically make a post asking for your opinions. I know my opinion isn't always needed or wanted, so I don't go sharing them in comment sections, I simply make my own post about it. People really run around putting others down and calling them names (very first comment they make, very first interaction they have with the internet stranger) for no reason other than to just be negative. \n\nLook; if you don't like something, you're more than free to go to a post you like and start a conversation there. But not every single thing, not every single post, not every single person and situation needs your two cents. It's really entitled and privileged to think and assume everyone wants and needs it. Just because you could do something, doesn't mean you should. Just because you could say something, doesn't mean you should say something. People need to learn how to be humble but Reddit is too \"edgy\" for that. \n\nBut ultimately this is my two cents. On my own post. I expect to get peoples opinions back since this is a broad statement. There's a difference between giving your feedback on something like this, where it's open and about more than one thing, and actively going to a rap song when you don't even like or listen to rap, just to down it and call it trash. Not every opinion is needed and beneficial. \n\nAnd back to the title of the post; quit going around ironically commenting and posting things people dislike and don't want just to try looking like that edgy person that doesn't care and wants to bend the rules.

When a war(aka peace mission) is deemed not beneficial for the West we just leave, even if the people in the are of the war are not much safer (Afghanistan,  Iraq). \n\nWhen other countries wage a war we decide to participate only for strategic reasons.
