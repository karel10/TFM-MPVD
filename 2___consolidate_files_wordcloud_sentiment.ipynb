      "Viability is the point where if the baby was extracted from the womb prematurely, it would still live and likely have a normal life. Once the baby reaches that point, it is a human, and aborting it is murder, plain and simple. Before viability is more of a grey area, so this legislation would allow the states to come up with their own laws, and the local populations could decide what type of restrictions they are going to have on abortions -- however, these states wouldn't be allowed to completely outlaw abortion in the case of a rape, incest, etc. as I listed above.\n",

People come to me for advice all the time about why they are unattractive, how to have sex, or how to get a girlfriend. In a way, I almost see it as a snowboarding instructor or another skilled instructor. Just because the activity is fun does not mean we should be demonized.

There is no doubt in my mind that states in California and New York will keep abortion legal for all cases up until 9 months. Heck they might even allow for post birth if they can.

So there you go all the states will allow for abortions if the mother's life is at risk and most will allow 1st trimester abortions and quite a few states will have it on demand anytime for any reason. So really most of the people who are pro choice already live in areas that will allow it anyways and the people who want to get an abortion will be able to do it anyways since most states will at least allow 1st trimester which is when almost all abortions happen anyways.

Right-wingers are more likely to stick to certain rules like less taxes or the free market, even if circumventing those concepts could lead to greater net happiness. Left-wingers are more likely to evaluate the action by their consequence on the net well-being of people, even if these actions run directly against concepts like right to life. What does this mean in practice? I'll try to illustrate it using abortion rights as an example:\n",

      "The Command and Conquer series taught me everything I ever needed to know about geopolitics and the game should be a required educational activity in schools\n",
      "Unlike other Real Time Strategy games, Command and Conquer isn't set in some fantasy or sci-fi world where humans are at war with  orcs or elves or zombies or aliens, or where machines are fighting each other.  It is set in a world where western nations are fighting with utopian terrorists over the world's most valuable resources -- in other words, it is set in a world a lot like ours.  In fact I'd guess that there are people who played Command and Conquer in the 90s as teenagers and by the early 00s were driving tanks across oil Iraqi oil fields taking out [technicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_\\(vehicle\\)).\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategic loop in Command and Conquer is as simple as it gets - you need resources to build military units, and you need military units to control resources.  Which means that when you see your opponents collecting resources, it's only a matter of time before there's going to be a bunch of tanks and troops headed your way.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's a great lesson, because in the real world, when countries build militarizes and invade resource-rich areas, like the US invading Iraq and Russia invading Ukraine, most of the debate is about how the war started, whether it was justified, what the goals are, etc.  Nobody really wants to admit that the point of having a large military isn't to just have it sit on the sidelines, its to acquire and defend resources, and yet the conflicts generally play out exactly that way, with troops being sent to poorly defended and resource-rich areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "A related lesson is that when you give or cede resources to hostile actors, they're almost guaranteed to be used against you at some point.  Europe never countered Russian aggression in Crimea or Georgia and continued to buy energy from them, and yet was somehow surprised when they invaded the Ukraine. Likewise, after the Iranian revolution, people were surprised that the new regime immediately launched an attack on Iraq..  And just this year the Taliban have just been given control of a country and billions of dollars in weapons, and in about a year everyone will be surprised when they attack one of their neighbors or even our allies.  Instead of being surprised all the time, we should heed the lessons of C&C and be prepared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important lesson from Command and Conquer is that you always need to be able to understand the conflict from the perspective of your opponent .  That's because if you want to stop a Hitler, Stalin, Bin Laden, or Putin, the very first thing you need to do is to think like them.  And there is absolutely nothing unpatriotic or wrong about having that discussion even though some people try to tell you differently.  (That you're supporting Putin or the terrorists or whatever by acknowledging that they have goals and motivations.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In Command and Conquer it is also pretty easy to send a few flame tanks or engineers to blow up an opponents harvester or a grab a building or two and sell them, but ultimately you can't win the game that way, it just a delaying tactic at best.  Terrorism in the real world is very similar - it results in loss of life and makes headlines, but really doesn't change the power dynamic because ultimately it just consuming resources.  This explains why after the 9/11 attacks, terrorists shifted their focus from attacks in developed countries to attacks in weaker countries in which governments could be established, for example Syria, Yemen, and attacking the weak government in Iraq, and also why the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had little lasting impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schools have been making headlines lately, and not in a good way - teaching kindergartners about gender identity or teenagers how privileged or oppressed they are.  Incorporating Command and Conquer into the curriculum would be a useful educational tool for understanding geopolitics and developing new strategies and tactics in the war on terror.  It would also motivate students to learn how to build the advanced technologies available in the game, such as the Ion cannon, tesla coil, mammoth tank, and the mobile construction vehicle.  Used properly, it could grab the attention of today's apathetic students and create a new generation of leaders ready and willing to defend civilization if it deserves to be defended, or else overthrow it if it becomes too corrupt and authoritarian, both noble goals  that seem to have been lost by the preceding generations..\n",

Example: California has a population of 39.35m people and America has   329.5m people. California has 12% of the population, so they get 12   electoral votes.

Cats lack endurance, and are not as widely distributed as Dogs. Studies have proven time and time again that the most successful, effective Predator in Africa is the African Wild Dog. When you look at where wild Cats and wild Dogs live, both today and throughout history, you notice one key thing. Dogs have made it to every major landmass. Cats have made it to every major landmass, except Australia, which has no wild Cats. No I'm not counting domestic Cats that are feral, I'm talking wild Cat Species. The most feared Animal in India, when it comes to other Animals fearing them, is the Dhole, India's Wild Dog, and even Tigers are afraid of them. Dholes have been said to attack and kill Tigers as well. Dholes terrorize the entire Indian forest, and as a pack, they are as deadly as they come.

      "I have always been pro-choice on the basis that I feel it is wrong to force a woman to continue to be pregnant against her will, intuitively it just feels wrong. I still consider myself \"pro-choice\" even know. But when I am forced to reckon with abortion by actually analyzing pro-choice arguments and their implications, I find it increasingly difficult to defend them (except for cases of rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother) and now feel morally conflicted.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The \"it is women making choices about their own body\" argument:**\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman choosing to have an abortion is not just choosing something for her own body, but also for someone else's body: that of the fetus. Fetuses are not part of the women's body even before viability because they are a separate entity with a separate DNA profile, and are just as much a biological product of the father as the mother. \n",
      "\n",
      "A woman is technically choosing what to do with her own body, yes, in that she is choosing to no longer be pregnant if she does not want to be, but she is also choosing to end the life of another entity which is not part of her physical body. The fetus draws nutrients from the mother's body to develop and grow, but that doesn't make it part of her body. To argue that it is, is factually incorrect.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The \"a fetus is a parasite and thus it is acceptable to kill it\" argument:**\n",
      "\n",
      "A parasite is defined as an organism of one species that attaches itself to an organism of ***another species,*** with the intent of extracting resources for its own survival at the expense of the host. By definition, a fetus is not a parasite. The fetus did not \"attach itself\" to the mother, the fetus is present because the mother and the father engaged in sexual intercourse, for which the known outcome is pregnancy. To describe the fetus as a \"parasite\" akin to a tapeworm is to dehumanize it with the intent of justifying its death by implying it is less than human and an invasive species, and using this sort of language to describe humans of any stage of development is inhumane.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The \"fetuses are less developed and therefore less valuable than their mother\" argument:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is probably the most persuasive pro-abortion argument, but it has deeply eugenicist undertones.  Note that I said above that a woman should be prioritized over her fetus if the pregnancy is going to kill her, but this is not based on me assigning more moral value to the woman over the fetus, it is that if the mother dies, the vast majority of the time so will the fetus, whereas the reverse is not true, so saving the mother saves one life, while trying to save the fetus is more likely to result in two deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any time we try to assess the worth and value of another person's life, of any stage of development, based on their characteristics or stage of development, we open the door to eugenics. If we try to imply a fetus is less worthy of life and thus can be killed because it is \"less developed\" or \"dependent on its mother\" then we no longer can clearly articulate why we cannot kill people who society deems as \"parasites\" or \"lesser than\": people who depend on machines for survival in the hospital, people who are disabled and do not provide any economic benefit to society and extract more resources from society than they contribute, the impoverished, people on welfare, people who are unintelligent, and so on. When you define the value of life in terms of development or ability to contribute to society, it has dangerous implications.

Even in schools where abstinence-only sex education is taught, people know that sex results in pregnancy. That a grown woman of sound mind would not know this is just something I refuse to believe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there are instances where birth control or contraception can be sabotaged by a controlling partner, or birth control can fail, and this is one of the reasons that I continue to acknowledge that there will always be exceptions in which abortion should be accessible, but the argument that banning abortion forces women to have unsafe abortions in the majority of instances is to imply that women generally have NO control over whether they become pregnant which is blatantly false. This isn't a moral dilemma but a falsehood. \n",
      "\n",
      "The argument that contraception is inaccessible is also false. Obtaining free or highly affordable condoms is not difficult. Birth control is usually covered by insurance. if a man and woman choose to not use these protective measures because \"condoms make sex less pleasurable\" or \"birth control throws off my body\" then you are making an active choice to risk a pregnancy occurring, and it is your fault if it does. Take responsibility for your outcomes. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. Women can give their child up for adoption and are not forced to be a parent against their will. To state that removing abortion makes women forced to be mothers is just not true. \n",
      "2. Men cannot just legally walk away from parenthood if the woman chooses to give birth and raise the child. Men see their wages garnished, driver's licenses revoked or points put on their license akin to if they got into an at-fault accident, or can be sent to jail for refusing to pay child support. A woman can choose to absolve herself of all of this by having an abortion, but men do not have the same ability, so not only is a woman making a choice about someone else's body (the fetus) but the man's entire life trajectory. And before you say \"well maybe the man should not have stuck it in, he had his choice when he refused to have unprotected sex,\" so did the woman. Abortion doesn't give women equal rights, it gives them special privileges over at least two other people's lives.\n",
      "3. Abortion clinics have been disproportionately placed in low-income areas inhabited primarily by people of color, especially Black people. Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, is on record stating that the goal of Planned Parenthood was to eliminate the Black population by reducing its birth rates. Abortion has led to far more Black deaths than police brutality, slavery, and genocides combined. Abortion is a wealthy white woman's issue, and has harmed the Black community irreparably, and is the reason why despite the Black population having higher number of children per household, the Black population has remained stagnant at roughly 12-13% for decades. Abortion is racist.\n",

      "**The \"abortion enables women to have fulfilling sex lives on their own terms\" argument:** \n",
      "\n",
      "This will make me sound like a 70 year old Christian conservative, but I do not feel that a culture that encourages promiscuity, depravity, and decadence is a good thing. Going home with strangers you met at a club or bar every weekend and having unprotected sex creates public health risks, including sexually transmitted infections, mental health issues, and is dangerous. You never know who you are going home with and what that person is capable of, and while it is not your fault if you are murdered or raped, a dangerous situation could occur that could be prevented if we did not live in a culture of hedonism. \n",
      "\n",
      "Abortion enables people to believe that they can make risky choices with no consequences, because there is always a way out. There IS NOT always a way out of every dangerous situation that can occur if you hook up indiscriminately with strangers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The other part of this, is that the notion that women are all pro-choice and men are all pro-life is false. Most pro-life charities and organizations are run by women, and there are many, MANY instances where men try to force the woman into having an abortion she does not want to have because he does not want to be a father. \n",

      "\n",
      "Let's establish something right off the bat. A statement of opinion is not defamatory, nor is a statement that's an evaluation of publicly available fact. So when people say \"Kyle is a murderer\", what are they saying? They're saying that what Kyle did that night in Kenosha fits the definition of murder. They can be referring to the legal definition or some other definition and it's still not defamatory. Just because he was found not guilty doesn't mean he's not a murderer and doesn't mean that you can't call him a murderer. Being found not guilty just means that the government failed to prove he committed the act beyond a reasonable doubt. That failure doesn't constrain anyone's free speech. That's why we can all call OJ Simpson a murderer despite his acquittal and why PETA can call all meat eaters murderers even though that's not the legal definition of murder.\n",

It's impossible to prove what he thinks or believes, and so any statements about state of mind are really just opinions.

      "\n",
      "This is the category of claims that might actually qualify as defamatory because they are actual factual statements. The problem is, Kyle is at least a limited purpose public figure. This means that for statements to be defamatory, they have to be made with actual malice, meaning they have to be statements known to be false or known with high probability to be false. So you'd need to prove anyone repeating this claim knew it was false at the time.

You can be sure if it was conservative individuals outside the homes of Justices Sotomayor or Kagel and there was an assassination attempt, the Democratic party would be sending in the National Guard to clean up the situation... however, when it is their own ideological partners at the heart of the action, they are MORE than happy to just turn a blind eye, even at the prospect of a conservative Supreme Court justice getting assassinated.\n",

After the ruling was passed, she \"found religion\" and became an anti-abortion activist, supporting politicians who were against abortion, and regretted her role in the decision to legalize abortion. She said that she was being used as a pawn for abortion activists. But then later, on her deathbed, she changed her stance again and said that her conversion to Christianity was financially motivated and that she had been paid to speak against abortion.\n",

They could easily argue that Roe changing her stance on abortion and converting to Christianity is proof that she didn't really believe in abortion, and would have been happy if the ruling was overturned, or that she was mentally unstable and didn't know what she really wanted, since she kept changing her mind about various things.\n",

I know there are things that people can use as leverage against them, but they are not John/Jane Does. Most people know who they are without having to look them up.

If I hate all people with red hair, and red-haired people start advocating against it, and someone who isn't a redhead tries to talk me out of hating on redheads I would be more inclined to listen. Because A, they are someone like me, and B they aren't a redhead. So to deny non-sexist men a chance to talk in this is simple stupid. \n",

Thats me as in my body, choosing not to go to jail. However you can't do that, and you wouldn't argue that I should have the right to do that, wouldn't you?

What if the man wants the baby and the girl doesn't? Should he just have so sit there and do nothing even though that's also his baby?

      "4.) Guns can kill multiple people A LOT faster and easier than a knife.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.) Most people either don't want to go through the trouble of creating and preparing a bomb, or they aren't smart enough to even make it in the first place. They are more difficult to use, and less easily accessible than a gun. This would probably explain why they aren't used as often as guns.\n",

Now, imagine if Ukraine didn't receive any military equipment from any nation at all. They would've been SOL, and they had their own military equipment!

      "\n",
      "However, in recent years, we have been seeing a wave of new gay rappers who have taken the rap and hip-hop communities by storm... such as Lil Nas X and Tyler the Creator, amongst others. Yet, this new brand of gay-positive rappers has created significant anger among many of the still-largely homophobic community. In an interview, Lil Nas X says:\n",

If anything, I hope and very much advocate for a new army of gay rappers come to dominate the genre and push out the hate-filled homophobic rappers. I want to hear new songs from rappers about their gay experience, about their gay love, about promoting gayness in the hip-hop world, and making rap more queer. Furthermore, once they take over, I hope that all homophobic rappers and their songs are purged and eliminated, their record contracts canceled, their music removed from platforms, because this would seem to be the only way to cure homophobia within this community.

      "Look I get learning other languages is good but when you're learning it just because of anime, then that's pretty cringe ngl. I can respect when people learn Japanese because of their culture or because of work or if you have Japanese roots and etc. But when you're not Japanese or even asian and you learn Japanese just because of anime, you're wasting your time. I have a classmate like this that learns Japanese because of anime, his phone wallpaper is anime. You won't even get to speak Japanese in your life like ever. I mean nobody even understands my classmate when he's speaking his native language. Plus Japanese people don't even like foreigners and I don't think it's bad thing.

Yet the left never says anything about those drownings because they are not dramatic and not blasted 24/7 over the internet and news channels. Second, 756 deaths, let alone 269 deaths, in a country of 74 million children is minuscule. It is nothing! It is the equivalent of 0. There is no statistically significant difference between those two numbers. That rate should be celebrated! Having a mass meltdown over it is just mass hysteria and beyond ridiculous. Children die at the same rate in Europe as in America. Why do leftists care about how they die? If the rates are the same, then it shouldn't matter. If you are only outraged because of the method of death, then you are just looking to be outraged. People need to be more level-headed and objective!

I am not commenting whatsoever on how they treated parents, or the officers who went in to save their kids. I'm pointing out that numerous officers immediately engaged the shooter, multiple were shot, and they never abandoned the school. As time passes, only more officers enter the building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could they have been cowardly? Absolutely. But the commanding officer who assessed the situation as no longer an active shooter and now a barricaded subject almost certainly did not do so out of cowardice.

I will reserve that judgement until I know more details about the shooting, because the last thing I want to do is pile on with the rest of the internet to tell a bunch of first responders they're responsible for the death of kids when they risked their lives and were told to stand back on either bad commands or bad information.

It is always easy to pin the blame for Chernobyl on technicians who failed to follow procedure on a routine and normally innocuous safety check for the plants' meltdown. It is always easy to blame the physician who accidentally overdosed a patient because he read the chart wrong after twenty years on the job. It is always easy to pin the blame on the grandmother who accidentally ran over her grandchild because she didn't check her rearview camera backing out of the garage for the child's death. What all these scenarios essentially miss is the systemic issues that come into play with these tragedies, that human error will always be part of the system and that confronting individuals who made a mistake in a crucial situation is a lazy way to convince oneself if not for this *bad* or *incompetent* individual, these things wouldn't happen. Maybe we need redundant systems in nuclear reactors to ensure that meltdowns are less likely when low probability events predictably align. Maybe we need automated dosage for patients so that a sleepy doctor doesn't result in a death. Maybe we should make new cars detect objects behind them and alert the driver like many do now.\n",

      "Maybe, just maybe, we should reserve judgement on the action of officers in an active school shooting until we know more about it, and focus a bit more on the systems that lead to a situation where a botched police response means a dozen more children dead at the hands of a killer.\n",

      "I don't think that the current system of limiting the President to a maximum of two terms, and automatically holding an election every four years where the incumbent President, if they are still in their first term, has to convince the country to vote for them again is working. Because every time a new President is elected, they basically undo everything the previous President did, only to have the next President restore it again. A recent example being Trump withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement only to have Biden re-instate it. The next President, if they are a Republican, will most likely withdraw the US from the agreement again.\n",
      "\n",
      "My proposal: Rather than automatically holding a Presidential Election every four years, they should instead, during the primaries, have the people vote on whether or not the President is doing a good job and therefore should remain in office. If the majority of the people like the current President, they will stay in office for another four years; no need to hold an election. As long as the people keep voting for the President, they will remain in office; no term limits. If, on the other hand, the majority of the people \"vote the President out of the ~~tribe~~ White House\", the incumbent President will leave office on January 20 of the next year, and the newly-elected President will take office. The previous President will NOT be eligible to be re-elected at a later date.\n",

      "The system would work similarly to a recall election (at least how it works in my state; not sure about other states), where the people would vote on whether or not the President should remain in office, and at the same time, vote for their preferred candidate in the primaries. If the majority of the people vote for the President to remain in office, that will be the end for another four years. However, if the majority of the people think the current President should NOT remain in office, then the election would proceed as it usually does when the incumbent President is not eligible to run again, with the Democratic and Republican candidates who recived the most votes in the primaries hold debates, the people will vote as usual in November, and the candidate with the most votes becomes the next President.\n",

It occurs to me that in the medical context if we are prepared to define 'death' or 'the end of life' as being linked to the ending of neural activity in the brain or cardiac activity in the heart then we should have a logical reason to accept that the 'beginning of life' should coincide with the beginning of cardiac activity in the heart and neurological activity in the brain.

What matters is that women have the right to choose.\n",

If i say this I haven't violated their rights in anyway but I have still done something wrong.

Even if we define the moment of death as the moment where neurological activity stops those who are approaching death seem to loose their personhood well before this arbitrary point. They also tend to loose their personhood gradually over a long period of time.

We should be advocating that the government actually does something about it; that would help the addiction, the money they extort from our health and it would make the country a better place.. but of course not. We never advocate for things that will better everybody as a whole because people are too damn selfish and ignorant. Its all about some make believe personal rights that literally do nothing but ruin families and lives.. how can you call yourself a decent person when you're advocating shit like that? \n",

We don't need or want you advocating our delusioned rights and delusioned freedom. You're hurting the country and society more than you are helping anything. If you really want to advocate for freedom.. advocate for good health, advocate for getting out of addictions and control, advocate for the betterment of families and keeping families together, advocate for the countless of young kids that see their parents smoking and start smoking, advocate for all the lost children that have lost their parents and families due to smoking, advocate for everyone that has no money because they spend everything on their addictions, advocate for the clarity of mind, advocate for the strength to quit, the strength, power and knowledge to do better, advocate for the dismantling of the governments control, advocate for all the people affected by tobacco, advocate for enlightenment, advocate for positivity, advocate for healing, advocate for the TRUE freedom of choice to live without being bombarded by unhealthy lifestyles, advocate for logic... and quit advocating for this other bullshit, especially when you're just an outsider looking in. People shouldn't advocate for shit they don't understand, experience or are affected. Half of people that advocate for anything never have credentials to even do so, so they don't understand the ramifications.\n",

They never once think \"hmm, maybe my opinion really isn't needed right now\" or \"well honestly I don't have much experience with said thing, maybe my two cents is irrelevant and unnecessary\".

People spend their whole day going around arguing and disliking posts. I don't care enough about your opinions to argue tbh and if I do, I'll specifically make a post asking for your opinions. I know my opinion isn't always needed or wanted, so I don't go sharing them in comment sections, I simply make my own post about it.

Without thinking, I let the “up next” timer run down, and I was directed to the next video then the next, each more aggressive than the last And so began a months-long tumble down the alt-right pipeline, but I was never able to acknowledge that I was trapped. I still considered myself a progressive; in my mind, I was not buying into the alt-right’s rhetoric, I was learning their arguments to make my progressivism stronger. But I was more easily persuaded than I knew, and even if my intentions were sound, Ben Shapiro spoke too quickly and Steven Crowder too aggressively for me to be able to process what I was hearing beyond a superficial level. My teenage mind could not keep up, and without any conscious understanding, I was cheering along with Jordan Peterson as he “destroyed” feminism and as “SJWs” were “owned” with “facts and logic.”\n",

      "Those who believe the Black Pill theory believe that looks are genetically determined, and that women choose sexual partners based solely on physical features (“lookism”), so whether or not a person will be an Incel is predetermined. The part that is completely false is “women choose sexual partners based solely on physical features”. NOT ALL women choose partners based on looks, some do but, the statement is still false. The argument I hear a lot from guys who DM me is “women only want a 6’ Chad”; when I tell them it is simply not true they ignore it & move straight to insults. The reason I know this is not true is because I am married to a man who is not 6 feet tall. My sister is dating a man who isn’t 6 feet tall. Plenty of other women are living proof that a man doesn’t have to be ridiculously tall to get a girlfriend.\n",

      "Now back to the Black Pill argument, not all women choose sexual partners based only on looks. Also, “looks” is very subjective, one woman can find a person attractive, and another can think they are unattractive. Yes, looks matter. But it’s an unsound inference to go from this experiment to the conclusion that “all women judge all men primarily and forever on the basis of their appearance”. I don't think these men are as ugly as they claim they are, it's just a way to keep this blackpill-narrative and blame women instead of taking a hard look at the mirror and see how much time they've wasted on this instead of growing as a person. If they think women, 51.1% of world population, are personally against them, maybe the problem isn't women. Growing just needs to happen outside of the comfort-zone. If you turn down a date you might get called a bitch. If you have sex on a first date you might get called a slut. If you get in a fight with your boyfriend because he’s a dickbag, you might get called a whore. I’ve been called a slut for not having sex with someone I did not want to have sex with.

As the Supreme Court is one of the three pillars upon which the government of the United States is built, any effort to delegitimize or question the authority of that branch can be interpreted as nothing short of an attack on democracy and the very foundation of this nation. Democratic politicians are threatening to pack the court with their obedient stooges, while protests in front of the court building have already turned violent. Even further, we have fringe leftist radicals threatening to dox Justices and MUCH worse. Apparently, all of the bellowing about \"threats to democracy\" after Jan 6th was just hot air, because it seems to be clear that the left and Democrats have no issues whatsoever in attempting to dismantle and delegitimize the very foundations of our government when they don't get their way.

In the Soviet Union, during the reign of Stalin, the Soviet constitution stated, that it supports a multiparty system, and that if a group of people wanted to create a party, the state would support that. Reality, however, is *a bit* different. You have the freedom on paper, but not in practice.\n",

But the consequences of that action are so punishing, that it's not real freedom is it. To be really free in that sense, would be to be free of the consequences of my actions. For an individual person in a vacuum, it's kinda cool to not face consequences. But do you want to live in a word, where *anyone* is free from consequences of their actions?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Freedom often has rules. Think of driving a car. You're free to go wherever you want. But there are rules, such as driving on the right side of the lane, speed limits, traffic lights, areas where overtaking is not allowed, etc. Would you have more individual freedom if those rules were lifted? Yes. But it would have a disasterous effect on society as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Freedom of speech. Truly a great thing. But what if the person exercising their freedom of speech is trying to gather support for a dictatorial and genocidal coup? Or just a regular genocide, where he wants to get rid of anyone belonging to group X. By granting that person their freedom of speech, we actually remove freedoms of people belonging to group X.\n",

However, back in the early 2000s, unless you were in an extremely liberal metropolis, you couldn't talk about being gay. Something being \"gay\" was used as an insult. There was even a joke tweet about how wearing jeans that fit would get you labeled as a metrosexual. A gay person couldn't just come out. Compare to now, where apparently you can't be critical of gay people. If you had to choose between the freedom of being yourself, or freedom of speech, which one would you chose?\n",

      "7. A lot of people who are complaining about freedom of speech on reddit, are just complaining of being downvoted. This is a reaction of the community. If you meet with a group of friends and start talking shit about one of their partners, you will get backlash. Similarly, if reddit deletes your comment, you might feel like your freedom of speech is restricted. But imagine you go to a Magic the Gatheric game store and start talking about how magic the gathering sucks or even \"MTG is for cunts\". You'd get thrown out.

      "So, I am pro-choice. But I have a different definition of it than most people do. For me, pro-choice isn't strictly about abortion. Abortion is a big part of it, but once you make it safely out of your mother's womb, you're no longer dependent on someone else's body to keep you alive, and therefore it most definitely is \"your body, your choice\", which I am a firm believer in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My body, my choice\" means a lot of things. It means not being forced to undergo any body modifications, like circumcision, piercings, tattoos, etc. (I'm not against those procedures themselves, they just shouldn't be forced upon anyone, especially young children). It also means that children shouldn't be forced to undergo any medical procedures, therapy, etc. without a significant amount of input. They shouldn't be forced to go to therapy for problems they don't actually have, and if they do need to go to therapy, the therapist should listen, ask questions, and take into consideration what the child is saying. The parents would of course still have to sign off on everything, but the therapist should be able to say \"Your child has made it very clear that they do not want to do x, y, and z because it makes them uncomfortable, and I don't think it's in their best interest to force them to do it. You are the parents, but your child is their own person, therefore they should have a say in what happens to them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing is that pro-choice to me means pro-life, pro-death, and the ability to choose between the two. If a woman chooses to have a baby, that is her choice.

My family is pretty liberal (I wouldn't say that we're far-left extremists, but we're left-of-center), yet they said that, while they encourage people to get the vaccine, ultimately it is their body and their choice.

It's that the culture and aesthetic, remaining virtually unchanged from 1955 until 2077, is extremely unrealistic. We all know that culture, as well as architecture, can and will change, and rapidly in an industrialized world. Just look at how everything changed from 1860 to 1890, or 1900 to 1930.

      "\"Marketplace of ideas\" won't happen unless platforms implement an lQ test requirement.\n",
      "The marketplace of ideas is the notion that the good ideas will dominate in a sea of competing ideas. It sounds good in theory, but this makes the flawed assumption that the majority of humans act rationally and in good faith, when this is not true. People have biases and emotions that cause them to ignore reason. Furthermore, many topics are inherently complicated; people may not always be willing to listen to the nuances of a topic or they may not even be capable of understanding them.  Because of this, it's not necessarily true that the best ideas will dominate in a marketplace of ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a platform to successfully implement a marketplace of ideas, its users have to be capable of rational thought and willing to prioritize rational thought when contributing to the marketplace. The former of these two is relatively easy to implement. By making some sort of intellectual puzzle or test a requirement to creating an account, you can weed out people who are incapable of higher-order thought. These tests should also present themselves randomly from time to time while someone is using the platform in order to mitigate cheaters who have someone else help them make an account. If the test is not completed in time or the person performs poorly, their account should be locked for some time. Repeated failures to complete these tests should result in a ban, with the opportunity for an appeal. This is not a perfect solution, but I think it will really minimize the number and impact of irrational individuals on a platform, ensuring that the majority of users are people capable of reason and logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other problem, that the majority of users must be willing to prioritize reason is much harder to solve. Intelligent people often resort to irrational arguments out of their desire to promote an agenda. If the majority of users on a platform are like this, you're not really going to have a marketplace of ideas. It may sound unlikely that the majority of people on a platform are just going to be agenda pushers, but I'd argue that this isn't the case at all. The people who are most vested in a platform to share ideas are the people who want to push agendas. They will be the ones most likely to participate in this sort of thing as well as the ones who will spend the most time participating. People without an agenda are probably not going to participate as much. The only potential solution that I can think of is some level of content moderation, but this runs the risk of leading to censorship, which ruins the whole idea of a free marketplace. If anyone can think of other potential solutions to this problem, please mention it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if we don't have a solution to the second problem, I think any platform that solves the first problem will be much closer to achieving a marketplace of ideas than any other platform that exists.

I am offering up the possibility that while human activity has GREATLY SPED UP the Earth's temperature, that the rising may be something that would naturally happen eventually, just not for thousands/millions/billions? more years. Why do I think this? Probably because the existence of an Ice Age indicates the existence of another extreme, a \"heat age.\" Anyways, humans are very intelligent, but we are not entirely above nature and natural processes.

You can probably find the video of her last ever performance less than a week before her passing, I've seen it and it's pretty morbid.\n",

      "So yeah you probably know where I'm going with this. Given JB's condition, it is questionable whether he even *wanted* to run, much less be president - but of course as we all know, given the circumstances and the situation, the pressure to push it was insane and through the roof and he was kind of cornered into a position where he couldn't say \"no I don't want to run\" even if that was the case. But it really does seem a bit worrying how during his speeches with the constant gaffes, it almost seems like he doesn't really want to be there - which is a little sad and depressing and rather morbid when you think about it like that.\n",

Kids should be taught something more inspiring, some epic mythology about human virtues and a higher purpose that unites us all. Not \"you're an ape, it's all random, there's no objective meaning in anything, everyone can decide for themselves.\" It makes people pick hedonistic purposes in life like sex, food and video games because everything is just as valid as everything else. \n",

But for everyday people in daily life it literally doesn't matter where we really came from, and we should de-emphasize that we are just animals and present a more noble narrative that teaches responsibility and idealism.\n",

I don't get why hating on Kim K's accent is fine but if I hated on, say, some random Indian immigrant it's not. Why is making fun of texas people's accent ok but not, random Chinese dude? A lot of Texans say dumb shit. So do New Yorkers, or Indians, or whatever. However, I don't criticize them for things that really isn't worth criticizing. (And I know reddit loves putting words in my mouth. I don't like Kim Kardashian, but I don't think there's any point in criticizing her 'vocal fry'. Thats her business if she fucks up her vocal cords. I also don't care about Texans for being Texans. Texans that vote for anti abortion laws can fuck off, but I still won't bully them for their accent because just because you have an accent doesn't mean you are anti abortion.)

If your dick can't get hard is that actually your biggest concern? How is is that women always complain about how men are selfish in the bedroom when like 80% of men seem to have their partner's pleasure paramount. I also have seen men explain that they can't enjoy it of she doesn't orgasm and they don't feel like a real man. I have even read that some men can ejaculate just by giving oral sex to a woman, WTF!? How!? There is no way any woman would be able to do that without being touched. I was bullied in school and have misogyny issues due to it and issues with my mother, it's a really long story but as a coping mechanism I began to fantasise about being a CEO and forcing my secretaries to have sex with me and suck my dick under the desk while I work.

I am recovering from my misogyny and have gone a long way since then(currently 17) and I particularly fantasised about my female school bullies becoming my secretaries and about fucking my male school bullies girlfriends/wives, whilst most boys thought about their crushes. Also, most men and teenaged boys seem to very aroused by hearing women moan and groan of sexual pleasure and pleasured facial expressions, this is almost a turn-off for me and it was hard to find porn that didn't include that, my porn was always boss-secretary porn. My desires for lovey-dovey affection have re-developed and it is confusing for me. Most women on the other hand will not tolerate anything less than men assuring they will make them orgasm first(which is paramount for most men anyway). Yet women still complain that men are selfish jerks who only care about themselves.

Working independently of musk, multiple different security guards repeatedly asked them for their employee badges and to leave the premises.

These actions are considered illegal, as the security guards were considered to have “actual or apparent authority to act on behalf of the party.”\n",

Gecewich testified that Pratt told him that he thought the information in the Facebook post was inappropriate as it included how much money employees made at Respondent, and Pratt thought that he was being singled out (Tr. 1807–1808).

Ortiz eventually admitted that it must have been Moran who sent the screenshots to him via text message but that he had received these screenshots from others as well (Tr. 530, 1842). Apparently prior to his meeting with Gecewich, Moran spoke to Ortiz about his meeting with Gecewich. During this meeting with Gecewich, Ortiz expressed concern about being fired and was worried in the prior meeting that he would be fired. Ortiz also spoke about his nature not to bring others into his own problems, and that he was protecting other employees including Moran (Tr. 1842–1844). By the end of this meeting, Ortiz had told Gecewich from where the photos had come.\n",

      "The stated reason for termination:\n",
      "\n",
      "After these meetings with Ortiz and Moran, Gecewich drafted a report of his investigation with recommended actions (Tr. 1846, 1850). Gecewich testified that he based his recommendations on looking at similar cases as well as the “unique facts of this case” (Tr. 1851). Gecewich testified that he considered Workday profile photos and any Workday screenshots to be sensitive; Gecewich’s characterization of the Workday photos or screenshots is based on his own belief that Workday is an internal data system (Tr. 1935). During his investigation, Gecewich claimed he never sought to learn what happened in Sacramento, went to the Facebook page to look at the page and never found out who were the members of the Facebook group (Tr. 1823, 1835). After drafting the report, Gecewich showed it to Tesla’s in-house counsel (Tr. 1849). Gecewich’s recommendation for termination of Ortiz and warning for Moran were “aligned with legal” (Tr. 1930). But a prior version of his report shows that Gecewich along with in-house counsel edited the investigatory report which was originally created on October 12 (GC Exh. 85). In a prior version of this report, Gecewich wrote, “This time frame corresponds to when these three Tesla employees went to Sacramento, California to speak with State legislatures about on behalf of Tesla” (Tr. 2201)\n",

      "\n",
      "A tesla manager fired an employee unlawfully and tesla's legal council okayed the termination based on what said manager provided them. Again reflects poorly on tesla, however, there is no concrete evidence that Elon musk was directly involved in said firing or that the firing was covertly because of Ortiz’s attempts at unionizing. Any claims of union-busting fall into the realm of speculation, and if so are likely solely Cecewich’s personal motives. My speculation is that Elon Musk was not directly involved in Ortiz’s firing, and especially not on the basis of Ortiz’s pro-union stances. Ortiz and his five supporters are a vast minority of the plant's 10,000 and likely wouldn’t have gained traction in such an anti-union work culture. I personally do not see any reason Elon musk would go out of his way to have Ortiz fired other than pure spite, which is possible but unlikely.\n",

Tesla has taken a step forward to ensure its batteries are more socially responsible and a step back. Firstly they are attempting to shift away from using cobalt in their batteries, using a more advanced version of Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries starting in their Chinese market. However, In order to ensure a steady supply of cobalt while they make this transition, they’ve entered an exclusive deal with Glencore. The company is known as one of the more ethical cobalt suppliers however in spite of this there is still evidence of child labor within Glencore’s supply lines: [https://freedomcollaborative.org/newsletter-archive/a-swiss-company-profits-from-child-labour-and-perilous-conditions-in-a-bolivian-mine](https://freedomcollaborative.org/newsletter-archive/a-swiss-company-profits-from-child-labour-and-perilous-conditions-in-a-bolivian-mine)\n",

      "Minorities who vote Republican should not mistake Individualism and Personal Responsibility for denigrating and insulting the rest of their communities they're supposed to represent.\n",
      "No one wants to be labeled negatively for their views, especially in the political atmosphere. Furthermore, no one wants to be labeled negatively for their political views when it's mostly considered an anomaly in their communities. This argument obviously applies to minorities, particularly racial, ethnic, and religious who vote Republican and not Democrat. When they usually do that, they're labeled as Uncle Toms, sellouts, etc. In particular, these terms are mostly applied to Blacks, but they're also labeled towards others as well. The reason is that their critics view the Republican Party as detrimental in their eyes in terms of race, gender, religion, etc. This has led to a lot of Conservatives to call the people who use such terms as racists. I overall agree that no one should label someone who has different views as you by a certain expression. You can debate them but it shouldn't get to the point that you have to start name-calling. That being said, there's an obvious reason why they use these terms and for the most part, they do have a legitimate point. If they want this to stop, this is what Minority Conservatives need to do to prevent it from continuing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's start off by saying that individualism and personal responsibility are overall great notions. No one wants to live a life of being a victim and being dependent all the time. Everyone wants to be successful. But what happens if it gets to a point that you make blanket statements associating negative stereotypes with the broader community that you're supposed to uplift and inspire so they can succeed just as much as you do? Obviously, people will get offended and you will be rightfully called out for it. As a result, you will not be considered a great role model in their eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The above argument is an example of the trap that many Minority Conservatives fall into. They use personal responsibility and individualism by making themselves look morally superior to others. This results in them constantly bashing their community by associating negative stereotypes about them, including people who don't fit such stereotypes. They say things like they have a victim or plantation mentality, are obsessed with complaining all the time, are lazy, incompetent, want freebies, and constantly make poor choices like committing crime, doing drugs, skipping school, joining gangs, having out-of-wedlock children, etc. That is why they're always unsuccessful. With that type of condescending attitude, how do you think you'll win over your community like that? Furthermore, they and the majority of their fellow Conservatives (majority of them being White) view Minorities through the lens of poverty if they vote Democrat and if they're successful, work hard, do well in school, have a decent income, have a strong family background, avoid gang activity, don't use drugs, etc., they vote Republican. There are a lot of successful minorities in America who fit all these categories and they don't vote Republican. Furthermore, there are a lot of prosperous Middle and Upper-Class neighborhoods and suburbs in America populated by minorities who tend to lean Democrat. What do they have to say about that? Are they existent to them or not? Because it doesn't sound like they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another argument that I want to make in regards to the statement I wrote above is that Conservatives will be the first to accuse Liberals of thinking minorities are a monolith who should think one way. But what they fail to realize is that they're doing the exact same thing. The Minority Conservatives are just as guilty of doing that as well. In fact, they're the repeat offenders of it. Overall, they think that the minorities are incapable of thinking for themselves. I really can't help but ask them if they see the hilarious and blatant irony in their arguments cause it seems like they don't. But hey, projection is their jam.\n",
      "\n",
      "To close off, my message to all the current and incoming Minority Conservatives is this: If you don't want to be called Uncle Tom, don't mistake Personal Responsibility and Individualism for putting down your own race, religion, etc. in order to gain acceptance from the majority, let alone the minority. It doesn't matter if you're White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, etc. It's cringeworthy and surprisingly enough, it's considered an example of shameless pandering. Not only that, you're creating new stereotypes of your demographic that are just as bad as the ones you claim to be against. We all know how you and the rest of your fellow White Conservatives love to criticize Liberal-leaning Whites for being self-loathing and having White Guilt and going further by referring to them as cucks, beta males, soyboys, girly boys, brown nosers, coal burners, etc. (all of which are similar in context to Uncle Tom and should be dubbed racist as well). I agree, it's just as cringeworthy. But that doesn't mean you should accept Minority Self-Loathing as well as Minority Guilt either, whether it be Black Guilt, Hispanic Guilt, Jewish Guilt, and Muslim Guilt. If you really want to bring change, don't be condescending to your audience. You're meant to be role models not grifters. And since Conservatives claim to not see color and see individualism, don't generalize your audience as a whole. Many of the Conservative outlets that you supposedly follow like Fox News and Breitbart have a tendency of looking down on minorities and generalizing them a lot instead of viewing them as individuals as they claim to believe, in particular the former when it comes to crime committed by minorities. An obvious example being \"13%\". It definitely is possible to be a Minority Conservative while not being a total and complete sellout. Good Luck, you'll need it.\n",

      "But what will also happened is that Ukrainian society will also become much alike Israeli society. I wont go over about everything it means but for our purpose this means that Ukrainian society will be more acceptable towards losing liberties if it means security, and it makes since because we Israelis were too willing to give up on liberties like with the mandatory service in the IDF because it means that our country will be safe, that what he meant by not wanting to be liberal western country.\n",
      "\n",
      "And another thing that will happened to Ukrainian society is that it will become more paranoid, after all, it was Russian citizens from your country who revolted and joined sides with Russia and those separatists were Russians, and I dont really think anyone gonna mind the amount of Russians who did not support the separatists, because after all, if they wanted to live in Ukraine they should have packed their bags and migrated to their country. They would pretty much give the \"compliance is soft support\" like they did with the Russians who live in Russia and dont overthrow their government since you know, they revolted and overthrew their government back in 2014. This isn't me saying that Ukrainian society will be racist, its just it will be more of \"respect and suspect\" kind of deal, like we have with the non Bedouin Israeli Arabs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what will happened? Well, first there will be marshal law across those liberated places, then, the population will be under surveillance and be suspected in case they ever try to separate again, which could happened since any separatist with luck that had managed to run way before hand will most likely be a terrorist and attack across the border like the Palestinian Fedayeen. Next, the Russian speaking population will start to feel antagonized and would wish for Russian liberation back again, or better yet they would form their own nationalism that is distinct enough from Ukraine and Russia. Golda Meir said that Palestinians dont exist but she was half true at her time, those countries in the middle east has only existed for around 20-30 years at this point and only existed cause a European diplomat said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, those liberated areas will start harboring terrorist organizations disguised as Russian liberation organization or LLO if you want. A situation that will force the Ukrainian army to deploy troops there to arrest and eliminate those terrorist cells, and since this is soldiers v terrorists in urban environment, civilians will get killed. Ukrainian soldier killed them? Terrorist? Doesn't matter he's a martyr from now on.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these things and more will probably lead to a Russian intifada, that will force Ukraine to go hard against those terrorists, and if a peace deal is ever made with that LLO, it would probably be sort lived as this deal will only give whoever in charge of that LLO a cover for any illegal activities he might want to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we forgot about Ukrainian people, who some will probably migrate back to these regions, putting them in conflict with the local population who would look at them as settlers that try to destroy the identity of the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "And add to that the fact that Russia, while weak diplomatically, could still recover from this war and gain allies diplomatically, allies that could antagonize Ukraine in the UN. Not to mention all the propaganda it still could employ, showing pics of dead children in Donetsk and saying \"this is what Ukrainian troops do\" while completely ignoring the fact there was an ambush of Russian terrorists on Ukrainian soldiers who caused a stray bullet to kill the kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you wondering how will the people of Ukraine will react to all of these? The same way we react in Israel. When we hear news about dead terrorist in Jenin we celebrate that a massacre has been avoided, when we think about the soldiers in the west bank we think of the separation wall (which is actually most just fence but still) we think of the fact that after construction it lowered the terrorists attack rate by 90% When we remember the disengagement from Gaza with all these settlers we think that they were, for a lack of a better term, ungrateful bastards who elected a terrorist group that shouldn't have been on the ballot in the first place, a group that launched rockets at our cities from hospitals and schools, which makes it even harder to pull the trigger when it comes to air strikes, heck we had to invent roof knocking with bombs.\n",
      "\n",
      "And why can we put up with all this things like mandatory service, the government being able to see what's on your phone at any time, delays of security when going to the airport? High budget for the armed forces? Any killing of Palestinians (innocent or guilty) Because in our society, that will soon become Ukrainian society too, security is above all else, because its better to be safe now and sorry later, because you cannot allow yourself to lose the next war because then you wont even have a country.\n",

Democracy requires true equality, which no modern capitalist \"democracy\" possesses, by virtue of the fact every country, even the relatively \"egalitarian\" Scandinavian social democracies, have people far wealthier and disproportionately influential than any others. In the US, it is absurd to claim we have \"democracy\" when the two-party system is little more than a neoliberal puppet of the capitalist class; the idea the average citizen, no matter how thoughtful or rational their ideas are, has any chance of being acknowledged on anything more than a token handshake or vague and empty response from his representative's staffers, is absurd. Don't get me wrong, I love our constitutional civil liberties, but time and time again, we see these rights—even when the constitution is very clear from a frank and common-sense perspective—be ignored or rationalized away if they are too inconvenient for the ruling class: NSA warrantless mass surveillance, internal border checkpoints, bans on civilian ownership of fully-automatic weapons (\"shall not be infringed\"), solitary confinement and other torture (\"cruel and unusual punishment\"), perpetual copyright, de facto wars without congressional approval, and holding prisoners without trial, all of these are very clearly unconstitutional to anyone with high school education in the English language who is being honest to themselves, yet all are rationalized and excused away be the courts nonetheless. Why? Because an entrenched elite *always* continually accumulates more and more power, and civil liberties, by there very nature liberties *the government* \"guarantees\" to not infringe, are inherently on very shaky ground. This is true of every state society, including Iceland, New Zealand, Sweden, and other societies we think of as near perfect democracies. Guess what?

      "An example of a true democracy would be the Iroquoian confederacies of the Northeastearn Woodlands prior to European destruction: Lack of significant financial inequality, a class system, presence of regular community meetings between true equals, and perhaps most importantly, the right to leave one's community or disobey orders from the Sachem or Clan Mother. Yes, there were exceptions to these rules, such as the Mourning Wars where captives were taken, and a maniac would be restrained or probably killed if s/he caused danger or severe disturbance. Obviously their societies were hardly perfect, but then you can note South Korea is hardly perfect from the standpoint of a truly democratic society, yet for a North Korean it would seem almost unimaginably good by comparison. But the Wyandot, Iroquois, and Neutral Nations had no prisons, no entrenched class system, and no significant economic inequality. No Iroquoian man, woman, or child had to worry about being evicted from their home if they couldn't pay rent, suck up to a boss they hate because they have to pay back their student loan debts. And while the False Face Society was very secretive, unlike the NSA, the KGB, or MI5 members of the False Face Society weren't constantly watching you in your longhouse, when you went hunting, or listening to your conversations with your family or friends. And the False Face Society—or indeed, the Grand Council itself—didn't force you to fork over 30% of your corn crop or catch in deer meat every year and send heavily-armed men to drag you out of your corn field when you least expected it and put you in a cage if you refused, and if you physically resisted these heavily-armed men you wouldn't be locked up in the cage for still longer or even killed on the spot.\n",

Centralization inherently breeds hierarchy, and hence we'd be back to being slaves of the ruling class and the state, maybe in some different form, i.e. right-libertarian corporatocracy or a quasi-pharoanic religious autocracy, but it will *inevitably* reemerge.\n",

The only societal systems which truly work over the long-term are stateless societies: Witness Native Californians, Australian Aborigines, Iroquoian and Algonquian peoples, and Khoisan bands in Southern Africa. Or, the longevity of modern Pueblo villages compared to the brief glory and then collapse of the Chacoan regime.\n",

In the times of the Haitian Revolution, if enough people got really really mad, the weapons of the elite were not so overwhelmingly superior a mass of the poor, working class, and underclasses could simply overpower them. Also, surveillance in even the most despotic preindustrial states pales in comparison to the what your boss can see on \"your\" company phone from his desk at work, let alone the truly behemoth power of the supercomputers of modern militaries and intelligence agencies. AI will either lead to one or two outcomes, probably both, in order: It will enable a totalitarian system where the elite enjoy near absolute power and luxury; and/or it will ultimately overthrow *all* mankind, and possibly destroy all life on Earth in an endless quest for resources, depending on its fundamentally inhumane motives.\n",

This system will not be uniform, far from it. I can easily see dry coastal areas being based on fisheries and aquaculture, not unlike what the Ancient Peruvians and Northwest Coast Peoples relied on; forest, wetland, and other well-watered areas being covered in vast forest gardens with many types of small livestock, fish, insects, and fungi being part of the local diets; dry and mediterranean areas being based on transhumance or clever irrigated agriculture, perhaps like the systems the Pueblo peoples have perfected over the centuries; boreal forests, tundra, and polar areas focused on reindeer or yak herding, low-input forest gardening systems, or hunter-gatherer ways.\n",

It is a false dichotomy, because many \"hunter-gatherer\" cultures like the Owens Valley Paiute, California natives, and even Australian Aborigines (read *Dark Emu*) practised what was basically equivalent to agriculture, just not *European* field and monoculture-based agriculture. Not to mention many, *many* long-standing, largely egalitarian traditional societies which practised what is indisputably agriculture, such as the New Guineans, the Puebloans, Iroquoians, many Amazonian peoples, and peoples of the Matrilineal Belt of Africa.\n",

To make concrete all that is needed is lime, aggregate, and baked clay—indeed, several traditional societies invented just this process. Ironworking is a hallmark of tribal Bantu Africa.

      "(tried to post this on r/ unpopularopinion but they flagged it and said it was just me complaining about \"daily annoyances\" even though i'd actually love to hear other people's perspectives on this. and it's not an annoyance lol it's a debate/unpopular opinion. i knew i should've posted it here, just thought i'd at least try the other subreddit first. my mistake).\n",
      "\n",
      "i am a cat person, and for good reason. don't get me wrong, i like dogs and i've even grown to love some. but when it comes down to it, i hold more respect and love for cats than i think i ever could for dogs.\n",
      "\n",
      "here's why...\n",
      "\n",
      "- cats are cleaner. they clean themselves, and nearly never need a bath. they aren't as rowdy and don't get themselves into nearly as many messes as dogs do. and they also don't usually smell at all (unless you have a bunch of them together, obviously that will accumulate a smell).\n",
      "- they're not nearly as codependent as dogs. they don't need attention 24/7, daily walks, or constant play time. they'll come to you when they desire your attention, and it's usually a fair amount before they want to be left alone again, so you're not being hassled all the time.\n",
      "- they're practically potty trained from the start. majority of cats only need to be directed to the litter box once or twice as kittens, and from then on they needn't be reminded again. they're also just easier to train in many ways (from mine and many others' experiences).\n",
      "- they're great exterminators! cats will chase and kill just about any bug or rodent you have around your home.\n",
      "- they're extremely smart. there's been debate about whether cats or dogs are smarter - and while the studies have come up as inconclusive, from my personal experience with cats and dogs, cats are smarter. while dogs, scientifically, do have more neurons than cats have in their brain, that can mostly be accredited to the fact that dogs were bred and genetically modified to be the way that they are today. it's also not known whether dogs actually *use* the full capacity of their brain. whereas cats have evolved and adapted to society and the environment almost entirely on their own. cats also have a much stronger ability to adapt to nature than dogs do. they can climb, hunt, hide, and survive in ways that a dog cannot. cats are also independent - while they *can* get along in packs, they can also survive on their own. the same cannot be said for dogs, who are known to be pack animals. they show more intelligience, more cleverness, and more adaptability than dogs do in so many ways.\n",
      "- cats can endure more. it's well known that's cats are more flexible and can land on their feet. they can jump from higher places, run and crawl through tighter spaces, etc. (however i will say that *because* they're able to handle riskier manuevers, it could make them more susceptible to injuries).\n",
      "- cats are neglected (mostly) because of dogs. you wanna know why you see so many stray cats on the streets? why you may happen across cats that have been hit by cars far more than dogs? because people prefer dogs. because dogs, for a particular reason, are viewed as \"better.\" i've seen so many people say that \"if you're not a dog person then you're a psychopath.\" and there's also so many negative stigmas surrounding cat lovers aka \"the crazy cat lady\" or \"witches and cats\" etc. people adopt and breed dogs endlessly, while cats are left out on the streets to fend for themselves. but honestly, i see more red flags with being a dog person. dogs are some of, if not *the* *most* submissive animals on the planet. they cater to your every demand, they flood you with attention and love, they submit to you in every way, they struggle to learn boundaries - and they've been genetically designed to be this way... to submit to humans. im sorry, but it's **weird.** if you hate cats because they're independent and think for themselves, then in my opinion *that's* more alarming... to hate something that doesn't submit to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "- (EDIT) dogs pose a bigger threat to humans. their bites are stronger, and when aggressive they can actually severely injure and even *kill* people. i've seen so many articles and news clips of dogs attacking, injuring, and killing humans. i've even heard of a dog biting off a toddler's arm, or a pack of dogs dragging someone into a ditch and chewing off their face. dogs are more violent, and some are even bred to be fighters. i've personally witnessed multiple dogs become aggressive and bite or slash open their owners, and other people around them, to the point of drawing blood and punching holes into the people's skin with their teeth.\n",

      "Not only did they make themselves the most important thing at the Oscars, but philosophically, I agree with both sides. I'm not even a Will Smith fan but some people do deserve a slap in the face. I'm also okay with Chris joking about Jada's baldness even if her condition is medical. The joke was tame and so is medical baldness. Chris also handled it well enough. Will got away with assault/battery, got an Oscar, defended his wife. Chris is admired for his restraint and professionalism. People actually cared about the Oscars again. It was exciting; like Chris said, it was the greatest moment in the history in television. Everybody was smiling. Will laughed, Chris laughed, we laughed. This is a win-win-win for everybody!\n",

      "The people who accuse others of being sheep are in reality the biggest sheep of them all.\n",
      "This opinion obviously applies to the current situation we have regarding COVID-19. With many precautions being implemented over the past several months in order to combat the virus, there's been some people out there who think they are so entitled to dismiss the severity of it, whether it be masks, vaccines, mandates, social distancing, etc. Instead, they claim to rely on their immune system, which in my opinion isn't really enough to combat it and it shows. As a result, they resort to calling those who heed to such precautions as sheep and lab rats. They even go further by harassing and threatening doctors who do their job to help cure patients affected by it as well as parents who decide to mask their children as child-abusers to comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust. And for the most part, these people obviously tend to be Conservative and are unvaccinated. But at the end of the day, who is getting affected and dying? The Unvaccinated or Vaccinated? The answer for the most part is the Unvaccinated. Why do you think that is? Obviously because they're constantly being fed propaganda and misinformation. Now, these people are suffering the consequences of their actions and their friends and family suffer as well. If anything, it seems to me that these people are the real sheep not the ones who they constantly accuse of. These are the same people who also for the most part don't tend to take any personal responsibility, especially since I mentioned before, the victims are mostly Conservative and personal responsibility is one of its main tenets. In conclusion, the real sheep who are being sent to the slaughter are the unvaccinated. Their constant obsession with owning the libs in the name of freedom have all but backfired. Hell, even our former president admitted that the unvaccinated are dying at a higher rate than those who are and he said it to a Conservative pundit straight to her face. He even got booed at a rally for taking the vaccine and even recommended his base to take it to no avail. Two examples that validate my opinion on this issue are Kelly Ernby and Robert Lamay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kelly Ernby, a former California prosecutor rallied against Covid vaccine precautions comparing it to socialism. She died of COVID complications in early January at the age of 46 setting off a chain reaction between the vax and antivax movements. Now, let's get to the next and main one: Robert Lamay. This death by far is one of the worst deaths of them both. This former Washington State Trooper had to retire early back in October due to his unvaccinated status and his criticism of the state's Democratic governor made him a viral sensation. He even had an interview with Fox News over it, which is pretty ironic since the studio has strict vaccine mandates themselves and 90% of their staff is vaccinated. This is clearly obvious over the fact that the interview he conducted with them took place in his squad car. Fast forward to February and he's dead as a doornail at age 50 from COVID and he leaves behind a wife and 4 children. Meanwhile, the studio for the most part remained silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, pretty much. The people who accuse others of being sheep are in reality the biggest sheep of them all. Now the question remains: Should we have empathy for them or not if they get affected and die? Obviously, we should. No death should be mocked. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be critical of them. We definitely should because they made a terrible and fatal mistake, one that was easily preventable and they need to be called out on that. Their deaths should also serve as a reminder of what could happen if others made the same mistake and to prevent it from happening. What's even frustrating is that the ignorance of these people is only making it harder to stop the virus. Like I said, personal responsibility and it goes both ways. Whether it be complying with the police as some people cry out, the same logic applies here. Furthermore, dying to own the Libs is not fighting for your freedom. It's fighting for stupidity. It also dramatically decreases your political base.\n",

      "3) Nobody cares about other biological factors giving certain groups advantages in athletics. Should freakishly naturally strong cis women be banned too?\n",

If there’s a controversy let a sports’ league deal with it, not some fucking senators overreaching their political power.\n",

While half true, the most fundamental aspect of the concept is missing from this definition, resulting in a gross oversimplification that leaves us with a definition much more closely related to racial prejudice rather than racism. As per its sociological application, in order for prejudice to be considered racism, there must be a system and institutions in place with which the dominant group (whites) can benefit from and leverage power over minority or marginalized groups. This is readily observable in the U.S through our policies (Jim Crow, redlining, [the war on drugs](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/race-mass-incarceration-and-disastrous-war-drugs)), hiring practices, (applicants with stereotypically white names are hired more frequently over applicants with stereotypically black names, despite the same [qualifications](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)), the [police system](https://www.ppic.org/publication/racial-disparities-in-law-enforcement-stops/), and a laundry list of many others. \n",

White people have not and will never experience obstacles or oppression at the macro-level to the degree that POC have.

A 7/10, however, means that the good things significantly outweigh the bad things, though there could be significant improvements. (As you go up the rankings the improvements become smaller and smaller). If something is ok, not bab, but pretty ok, then it’s average inside the good side. The same goes for the bad side.

I will either date her, or have a casual friends with benefits thing with her, depending on what either of us want out of each other. So, she found a way to make some extra money, and it just so happens to be from her body.

No such policies are being enacted on the women of the nation, and in fact there are polices to explicitly get women out of the country for their own safety. While people might say something along the lines of \"But its practical for the nation to do these things\", that same reasoning is also the reason for what I said in the title should be allowed.\n",

I think the draft should apply to both men and women, and I'm just pointing out the logical conclusion the former leads to.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary reason for women being shielded from conflict isn't, as popular opinion seems to think, the fact that women aren't capable of fighting. Its reproductive asymmetry that is the main reason. The concept of a draft is to force a segment of the civilian policy to fight wars, often with minimal training due to the draft being made to supplement a professional army. In the same way women are less capable than men on average to fight, so are regular civilians being conscripted to fight in comparison to professional soldiers. With modern technology, specifically the advancements in firearms, children are fully capable of being used as soldiers if the many conflicts in Africa are to observed. Considering the situation that part of Eastern Europe is in, ever potential soldier they can get would be useful, yet women are still exempt. Its the reproductive asymmetry that matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the modern context of what can still be applied to today, the average male has the biological capacity to impregnate dozens of females. Meanwhile the average female would probably be capped at 10 children, and that's assuming they are being used as a pseudo-baby factory from 18 years onwards. I don't think I have to explain the 8th grade anatomy as to why this is.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the male only draft is being implemented because its more practical for the war, then pro-birthing policies would be made during or after the war itself to recuperate the lost population. When the dust is settled and if that place in Eastern Europe survives, the nation will need to rebuild, not just economically but by population as well. Countries have historically promoted policies that encourage higher birth-rates to replace the dead. Post WW2 USSR is a well known example. If men can be forced to undergo all of that, why should women get a free pass for footing their end of the bill? Why is war mandatory for men, but replacing the shrunken population, something that is in the interest of the nation which the male only draft was also made for, too much?\n",

      "With this said, if you think that it is acceptable to force someone into a war they don't want to fight. To risk grievous bodily injury, death, or an extreme form of pain in one or both of those things. To fight for something that may not even believe in, and to trap them in the country in which this conflict is occurring, punishing those who do not obey, then rape is comparatively more acceptable. Is emotional trauma really worse than what I just described? PTSD exists, and I'm pretty sure that your average male civilian who is forced into this situation isn't going to be as mentally tough as regular soldiers, so PTSD rates will be higher.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the interest of the nation, women should try and have as many kids as possible until the government says to stop. If you don't want to do this, then remember what happened to the men who refused to fight. What's your excuse for not contributing to the effort as you hopped on a train to safety, leaving your fellow citizens to potentially die, all while you do nothing? Rape isn't even the first answer. The government would probably just tell you to pick someone and go from there. Rape, obviously the kind that would impregnate them, would be the last possible action to be permitted against these women. Complain all you want about the 1900s, that was the time period and its not like life was a living hell for them. Back then, gender (or rather sexual) equality was \"Julie didn't get to go to university, while John didn't get to live\". All the progress that has been made so far. How many \"White Feather Girls\" would refuse service if they were the ones who are told to go to the frontlines to fight with the men? Gender equality means you suffer the same as men, just as much as you prosper. If men who refuse to fight are cowards, what are you? How privileged to you have to be to cry out at the first sign of pain, all while turning a blind eye to, even support the actions that cause pain to others.\n",

      "\n",
      "The bill doesn't say anything about forbidding teachers from discussing THE CHILD'S sexual orientation, just sexual orientation in general. As a concept. To me, a lesson on sexual orientation is as simple as, \"some people are gay, some people are straight.\" This is just objective reality that children are going to be exposed to if they meet another child with two moms, or a teacher with a same sex partner. That's why Democrats are calling it the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill: because it literally says you can't instruct about sexual orientation. That's what \"gay\" is. Is it \"deranged\" to worry that gay people can't be acknowledged or talked about in a classroom? Are we saying a gay teacher can't talk about their spouse, but a straight teacher can? Or neither should be allowed to?\n",
      "\n",
      "Am I missing something? The only argument I could envision from a Right wing proponent is \"well, sexual orientation in the bill doesn't mean *sexual orientation*, it means... blah blah blah.\" But that's the same argument as \"defund the police doesn't mean defund the police\" which the Right hates. So how come the Right gets to take what Democrats say literally and criticize them for \"double-speak,\" but the Left are wrong to take the Right literally when they say \"don't teach about sexual orientation doesn't mean Don't Say Gay?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If the bill is meant to restrict something other than lessons that gay people literally exist, why doesn't it say so? Conservatives are claiming it seeks to prevent grooming but it doesn't say that. It implies that teachers cannot teach even that gay people exist at all. And then why shouldn't we take it one step further? \"Straight\" is a sexual orientation. Should teachers be forbidden from acknowledging their opposite-sex partners as well? Should books with married couples be banned? Clearly Republicans don't mean that. But they spend so much time making fun of Democrat double-speak only to employ similar vague, doublespeak tactics here. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's clear that what Republicans want out of this bill is for teachers not to teach kids that they may be gay or trans. But by forbidding the discussion of these topics completely they create a kind of Streisand effect situation of gay now being a taboo thing you learn on the playground instead of the classroom, and risks creating a culture of shame and bullying against, say, the kid with two moms that the teacher isn't allowed to teach a lesson about.

Why the hell would they initiate a slow, mass-murdering invasion with the intention of killing the guy with the finger on the button, giving him plenty of time to press it? Surely, they would have either exposed them before the invasion, staged a coup or made it their main priority to secure the weapons first.\n",
      "2. **Secondly, there's the US perspective.** It makes absolutely no sense to fund biological weapons in an active warzone with major threat of exposure from not only the Russians, but also internal corruption and the ever-increasing EU integration. Build that shit in Alaska or make a deal with an allied dictatorship in stable conditions.\n",
      "3. **Finally, you got the Ukrainian perspective.** If they actually had biological weapons or the credible threat of it, they could easily force the West to interfere if it wasn't enough to have Putin back down. The only reason we're not blasting Russians in Ukraine is due to a ridiculously small risk of a nuclear response.

      " So let me explain my reasoning. It seems like sexuality is a bit of a spectrum and its pretty rare to only be on the edge of one side. This is because I feel like that if most men were exposed to femboys or trans women they would actually somewhat enjoy it. Sure some of them would not like it because \"Ew its a person with a penis\" which is true but that being said a lot more men then you think would probably have sex with at least one of them. After all on reddit all you see is people talk about femboys and generally those people say they are straight. I have also had personal experiences regarding this. That personal experience was when I accidentally ran into trans porn when I was 13 and having sexual feelings with it. A week after that I was turned on by full on gay stuff which leads me to believe that sexuality is more maulabile then I might have thought. I don't think its nessericaly a choice and some people are just born straight or gay but I do think to some extent most people are born somewhat in the middle and more near the straight side. This is probably why the people that wrote the bible made homosexuality a sin due to the need for breeding during those times and them seeing homosexuality in themselves and feeling shame. I do think its fine to be bi though and I would like for people to be more honest with themselves. That's what bugs me at the end of the day is people lying to themselfs.\n",

These critics would always go on about how we don't need such a military in the modern world of today, that it serves no purpose and that no such situation could arise where a military such as America kept on hand would be necessary. They would then point to Europe and say \"SEEE, these European countries barely have any military any longer and put a small fraction of resources into military compared to the US.\n",

      "However, with the situation now in Ukraine, where we are looking down the barrel of a situation where you have Russia invading Ukraine, an action that is backed by China, it is suddenly becoming apparent that this situation could expand to a level and scope that expanded well beyond Ukraine and potentially into the rest of Europe. With such a situation rearing its ugly head, I would imagine at this point all of those critics who laughed at the US for keeping such a large well-funded military must feel quite foolish now, especially those Europeans who would constantly mock the US about its military, as, if things do indeed fall apart in Europe and Russian tanks start rolling west, Europeans will unquestionably have to rely on American might in order to fend off such an attack, as most European countries sit nearly defenseless themselves against such an onslaught.\n",
      "\n",
      "If leftists had got their way over the last several decades in the post-Cold War era, who desperately wanted the US to reign in its military size and funding and keep only a small military presence akin to what Europe does, no doubt the West would have no defense at all against any potential land war that we seem to be looking at the possibility of at this very moment. So, to all those who much such ill-informed statements over the years, I hope you all feel quite foolish now, because, like I said, if things in Europe deteriorate even further and Russia begins to charge west across Europe with the backing of China, the US will be the only thing to defend against such an action, so, I hope all those critics I mentioned above feel quite foolish now.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hence \"zone\" - a specific point where their closeness is somehow mutually exclusive to the other kind of closeness. Or just straight up the idea that friendship in general is mutually exclusive to intimacy. And yes, as dumb as that sounds, that's what it means.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, these days when someone is rejected by someone they recently met, it's silly and wrong to say that they were \"friendzoned\" or \"in their friendzone\" - because there was never a friendship to be had to begin with, they barely know them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, whether that's actually a thing and the people in question actually do have people they feel that way about, is up for debate - since it could just be that they're simply not into them regardless and it has nothing to do with their 'friendship'.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whether it's true or not, generally the idea is that being friends with someone is what's primarily contributing to hurting the possibility of being seen as date material. Or in simpler terms, the idea that an *existing friendship* is somehow a dealbreaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, either way, the reasons people believe that and partly why the concept came to be, I'd say are pretty valid even if they're based on a misunderstanding - a valid misunderstanding.\n",

      "It's usually because often when people start dating in their younger years - or trying to - when they get rejected they'll often hear things like:\n",

      "\n",

      "See the pattern? It's only natural that once a large number of people hear that regularly, it would send the message that it's their *friendship* or the type of relationship they cultivate with people that hurts them in the field somewhere along the way - I mean, logically it would make sense to draw that conclusion, no? So yeah naturally they will shy away from befriending people they're into and just go for it as an all-or-nothing approach, since they'll associate 'friendship'/siblinghood as something mutually exclusive to being a partner - because, well, that's basically what they're repeatedly told - that it's the friendship that's the dealbreaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then again, there's also the possibility that despite a large enough sample size of people mentioning friendship when rejecting someone, all those lines about friendship and siblinghood and closeness were just sugarcoating platitudes and they're just straight up not into them, for reasons completely unrelated to their approach in the relationship they cultivated and it has nothing to do with that. After all, lots of times people start dating after having already known each other for years. So clearly \"friendship\" isn't always a mutually exclusive dealbreaker. A lot of the time also people develop feelings they didn't have before.\n",
      "\n",
      "And sure, maybe some have people they actually do feel that way about and their closeness really is what would be a dealbreaker if the idea were to be floated. After all, sometimes you'll hear secondhand gossip like \"Damn, I can't believe John asked me out... he's like a brother to me\". Which is an indicator that it's a little more than 'letting someone down easy' - since they're saying it about someone when they're not around, rather than to their face. But again, it could just be that they still straight up aren't into John and never would have been regardless of their 'siblinghood', and just feel guilty about that and are using that to self-rationalize that mentally. Who knows.\n",

      "Comparing covid lockdowns to laws against drink driving is a false equivalency for a multitude of reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "1: Laws against drink driving do no violate established civil liberties. They do not impact freedom of expression, freedom of movement, the right to a speedy trial, the right to be free from searches without a warrant or the right to work. The same can't be said about lockdowns.\n",
      "\n",
      "2: Laws against drink driving are limited in scope. They only require somebody to refrain from drink driving. Lockdowns impact most if not all aspects of a person's life. They impact the person  both socially and economically and in so many other ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "3: Laws against drink driving do not cause harm. Although not being able to drive home while drunk may be annoying, the benefits of not driving home drunk absolutely outweigh downsides. Lockdowns cause widespread harm to society including social, psychological and economic harm. This harm disproportionately harms the most disadvantaged and vulnerable members of society.\n",
      "\n",
      "4: Laws against drink driving achieve their intended purpose. Laws against drink driving do in fact save lives and are supported by science. Lockdowns save little to no lives and are not backed by science. Every pandemic plan prior to covid-19 opposed lockdowns and current studies are showing that they have slim to none impact on saving lives from covid-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "5: It is more difficult to use laws against drink driving as a political weapon. Lockdown rules can easily be used to target and shut down political groups and movements. This is seen in both third world countries and in western countries as well. For example, Victorian Premier Dan Andrews shutting down the entire construction industry to punish them for a protest and the Chinese government using covid restrictions to restrict the travel of political dissidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "6: Laws against drink driving are proportional to the threat of drunk drivers and there doesn't seem to be any viable alternatives to laws against drink drivers. Lockdowns are disproportionate  to the threat of covid-19. Although covid-19 can make people from some demographics very sick, it doesn't pose a serious threat to the average person. We also have some vaccines that can reduce the severity of the disease. Focused protection is not just a viable alternative to lockdowns, it also saves lives unlike lockdowns.\n",

Supposedly being trans is not Christian, it’s a choice, it’s a sexual deviancy, it’s body mutilation. None of these arguments have any basis at all. They are just unfounded claims. Anti LGBTQ propaganda comes in and takes advantage of a lack of study into the topic. If you would like me to explain how being transgender isn’t a baseless claim I will. From multiple MRI scan studies it has been discovered transgender people have brains matching their gender identity, rather than their genitalia identity.

      "*\" The astral order in which we live is an exception; this order and the considerable duration that is conditioned by it have again made possible the exception of exceptions: the development of the organic. The total character of the world, by contrast, is for all eternity chaos, not in the sense of a lack of necessity but of a lack of order, organization, form, beauty, wisdom, and whatever else our aesthetic anthropomorphisms are called. Judged from the vantage point of our reason, the unsuccessful attempts are by far the rule; the exceptions are not the secret aim, and the whole musical mechanism repeats eternally its tune, which must never be called a melody - and ultimately even the phrase 'unsuccessful attempt' is already an anthropomorphism bearing a reproach. But how could we reproach or praise the universe! Let us beware of attributing to it heartlessness or unreason or their opposites: it is neither perfect, nor beautiful, nor noble, nor does it want to become any of these things; in no way does it strive to imitate man! In no way do   our aesthetic and moral judgements apply to it! It also has no drive to self-preservation or any other drives; nor does it observe any laws. Let us beware of saying that there are laws in nature. There are only necessities: there is no one who commands, no one who obeys, no one who transgresses. Once you know that there are no purposes, you also know that there is no accident; for only against a world of purposes does the word 'accident' have a meaning. Let us beware of saying that death is opposed to life. The living is only a form of what is dead, and a very rare form. Let us beware of thinking that the world eternally creates new things. There are no eternally enduring substances; matter is as much of an error as the god of the Eleatics. 1 But when will we be done with our caution and care? When will all these shadows of god no longer darken us? When will we have completely de-deified nature? When may we begin to naturalize humanity with a pure, newly discovered, newly redeemed nature?\"* As Pablo Olmedo wroted ( my translation): *\"a priori structures are not ahistorical and independent of sensitivity, if the organization of our reason is variable, in the sense that it is subject to a development process, it is not possible to affirm the need to think the bodies organic from the consideration according to final cause\".*\n",

Nowadays, when suffering is invariably quoted as the chief argument against existence, it might be well to recall the days when matters were judged from the opposite point of view; when people would not have missed for anything the pleasure of inflicting suffering, in which they saw a powerful agent, the principal inducement to living. By way of comfort to the milksops, I would also venture the suggestion that in those days pain did not hurt as much as it does today; at all events, such is the opinion of a doctor who has treated Negroes for complicated internal inflammations which would have driven the most stoical Europeans to distraction -- the assumption here being that the negro represents an earlier phase of human development\"*.\n",

At this point, she filed to reinstate her voter registration, and is now sentenced to prison for 6 years for voter fraud and trying to vote while a convicted felon.

It also says that basically all the research done before it shows that teacher pay has no real effect on student outcomes aside from correlations like rich kids in rich districts would have relatively higher-paid teachers but that wouldn't really be the cause for any of the above.

To be more specific about the specific issues I think we can definitely achieve universal free health care, a better social safety net, re allocate some funding towards teachers, raise the minimum wage, etc. I don’t agree with all leftist issues btw. Just mostly I lean left. I know this is probably gonna get downvoted to hell because I used to be one of the people that would downvote this instantly because it is not in line with the right.

Any mother in the same situation would have made the choice to save their own children if they had to. This does not make her evil.

First of all, she does it to correct the humility Joffrey suffered of being beaten by a girl and bitten by a wolf. Also, in the modern era we put down dogs who bite humans, which makes her action even more reasonable, and she doesn’t know whether Arya and the Wolf ambushed Joffrey or if Joffrey started the fight (which he did), as she wasn’t there. And she obviously believes her son before Arya. This reasonable justification is something I think differentiates her from the truly evil characters like Joffrey and Ramsay, they don’t need a justification for their actions. They are cruel for the sake of being cruel. And other characters like Tywin who I also consider evil have extremely flimsy excuses for their evil deeds, (Tywin is unnecessary cruel to Tyrion for his mother dying in childbirth, something he has no responsibility for. Tywin is extremely intelligent and knows deep down that Tyrion doesn’t have any responsibility which is why his continued cruelty is evil).\n",

Cersei gives Ned ample opportunity to swear loyalty to Joffrey and return to Winterfell, unharmed with all his men and both his daughters.

Also another thing i want to add to soviet industrialisation is that they focused way too much on Heavy industry. Light industry sucked badly. Like really really badly. There was always lack of specific good in soviet union that were very hard to get, and some which were too cheap to get. That is mainly due to communism economics.

      "There, I said it. And yes, I strongly agree with it. And this officer is a strong example of why. Here's the breakdown of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mohammed Noor is a former Minneapolis, Minnesota cop who killed Justine Damond, a young yoga instructor. So here's the story. On the night of the shooting July 15, 2017, Damond called 911 to report a woman she thought was being raped. This resulted in two officers, one of them being Noor to be dispatched to the scene. But there was no evidence of such after the investigation. But then, Damond approached the squad car they were in and Noor fired his gun at her killing her in the process claiming that he feared for his life. This killing led to global outrage and he was eventually charged and sentenced, initially for 12 1/2 years but was now reduced to 57 months. That's the summary of what happened that night. But here's where things take an interesting, ironic, and hypocritical turn.\n",
      "\n",
      "We've seen a lot of incidents regarding police brutality/shooting here in America where for the most part, the victims are ordinary Black citizens and the suspects are White cops. Such cases have pitted people in two groups, obviously Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter. When the trial for the cops are set, they are usually found not guilty of all wrongdoing. According to Black Lives Matter, they think the killing was unjustified for whatever reason. For Blue Lives Matter, they think the victim should've complied and that the cop was doing his/her job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let's cut to the chase. This particular police shooting is significant as the cop is a Black Somali Muslim immigrant and the victim was a White Australian immigrant. Do you think Blue Lives Matter will support the former? The answer.......was surprisingly, NO. Instead, they supported the innocent victim. And as a result, the narrative was flipped upside down and a new one emerged. Many people, particularly on the Right (which Blue Lives Matter is usually supported by) have grown critical of the officer who they believed was fast tracked due to affirmative action. They even brought up past allegations of misconduct made by him. This abrupt change in tone has caused many people, most notably social justice activists/Black Lives Matter to question how certain victims of police are usually portrayed by the media with White victims being labeled innocent and Black victims being labeled as villains. They even predicted that if the officer was convicted, it wouldn't be surprising at all. And yes, if you're wondering Black Lives Matter along with other groups marched in support for Justine Damond.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here's my conclusion, the fact that Blue Lives Matter isn't coming to the support of the officer in this particular case goes to show that it's a sham organization cause obviously, not all Blue Lives matter with this guy being one of them. They always say the same thing about Black Lives Matter but not in the case with their own group. It also debunks their belief that All Lives Matter as well as the Conservative message that they don't see color and see everyone as equal because obviously this wasn't the case here due to their accusations of affirmative action against him. In fact, in my opinion when I hear them say that they don't see color, they obviously mean they only see White as White isn't a color.\n",

I personally agree with them that victimhood and thinking one way shouldn't be required and that character does matter.

We got people like Tomi Lahren complaining about Wars on Straight White Males, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter, and Nick Fuentes complaining about demographics, Evangelical and GOP leaders complaining about an LGBTQ, Muslim agenda being implemented, as well as the War on Christmas bullshit, etc. The recent controversy over the national GOP accepting members of the LGBTQ community (Log Cabin Republicans) has caused many state GOP leaders to condemn it. And speaking of my last comment about content of character that Conservatives love to preach, whenever Right-Wing media outlets like Fox News and Breitbart report crime stories done by minorities, in particular Black people, the comments are usually filled with racist comments like the N-Word, 13%, and other outrageous stereotypes. Go onto the GOP's recent page when they posted Black History Month, so much White Grievance in the comments. The same can be said about the GOP's recent page wishing Muslims a Happy Ramadan.

One that is much more worse and hypocritical than the Left's. And as they continue to ostracize these communities, they continue to profess confusion as to why they think one way. Here's my answer to their troublesome ignorance: They think one way for a very important reason and it definitely wasn't on-purpose. It's because you constantly berate them to the point that they start to radicalize and as a result, they think collectively and start embracing their identities more. Once you pull the trigger on them, they'll fight back. In other words, turn around, fair play.

This is why your party is predominantly White and it's ironic that you preach against such a notion when you don't look at the makeup of your own party. They created this and they should own this. After all, you are the party of responsibility, you should own this. If they really don't want identity politics to exist, they should actually see them as equals and not inferiors. And that will happen if they denounce all the attacks their fellow members on the Right make about them. That includes denouncing all the Republicans who pulled the birther movement on Obama among all the other racist and bigoted comments against him and his family. To me, that is going to be an uphill battle because if they do that, they will be considered as woke, panderers, and virtue-signaling. Even worse, they'll be called Cucks, which I addressed in a recent post on this sub as the White Conservative version of an Uncle Tom. In my opinion, a huge double standard. Not only that, they shouldn't sheepishly hide behind the First Amendment as a shield when such incidents happen because it will lead some people to believe that they indirectly support it. If you have a problem with those terms being used, too bad. Remember, we're not supposed to be politically correct.

I for one would like people to be judged as individuals, but if one party constantly preaches that yet goes against it every time like what the GOP does, they need to do a little soul-searching and rebranding.

      "Sometimes schadenfreude is necessary to prove a point about the seriousness of certain issues because many people display arrogance in the face of danger until it affects them. The Herman Cain Award which tracks COVID deaths is one example as it keeps track of how people don't take it seriously.\n",
      "No one wants to take pleasure in someone getting sick from a certain illness and dying because of it, especially from a virus such as COVID. But what would you do if someone keeps denying the severity of it getting to the point where they don't adhere to any safety precautions such as wearing masks that they end up getting affected by the virus and die? Would you mourn them, consider it karma, or both? I'd do both and what better way to express it than with the Herman Cain Award. This popular Reddit site is obviously named after former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain who was diagnosed with COVID after attending an Oklahoma Trump rally maskless. Prior to his diagnosis and death, he expressed skepticism as well as mocked the severity of COVID and after his death, this sub was made and it continues the tradition of tracking down anyone who constantly brag and deny the severity of COVID as well as all the health regulations required to combat it. It even includes ghoulish memes ranging from racist, sexist, bigoted posted on their social media wall. This site has resulted in a lot of criticism mostly from the Right criticizing the Left for celebrating death, especially since the majority of deaths are from Conservatives. But in reality, it doesn't celebrate death at all. All it does is raise awareness and promote frustration over how people are not taking COVID seriously. And it just doesn't help that the majority of deaths are from Conservatives since they are constantly being fed misleading propaganda about the virus. At the same time though, it's hard to gain empathy for such people who act this arrogant as they are asking exactly what they want. But the amazing irony behind this is that the same people who are criticizing the subreddit didn't have a problem with Rush Limbaugh mocking people getting diagnosed with and died from certain illnesses such as Parkinson's Disease and AIDS. So it has me wondering, maybe if one can engage in schadenfreude like what Rush did, why should the same people take offense with the Herman Cain Award?\n",

These are the same people who get offended when minorities say the same thing. That itself is a huge double standard.\n",
      "We've all heard of the term \"Uncle Tom\", right? Used mostly by minorities, particularly the Black community when they see people of their kind who think differently and in the end vote Republican instead of Democrat? You know, like a \"self-hating person\". And when that term is used, Conservatives particularly White Conservatives get offended and up in arms criticizing them for being racist for supposedly stating that they should be thinking one way. But what they fail to realize is that they use very similar terminology to describe Whites who vote Democrat or are Conservatives who have moderate views on certain social issues like race, religion, gender, sexuality, and of course immigration. Such examples of terminology are \"cuck\", \"beta male\", \"soy boy\", and \"girly boy\". The first term is the most common among the four. Some people have stated that these are alt-right terms and that they are not common among Conservatives, but if you check out Conservative outlets like Breitbart, Fox News, etc., the users use those terms a lot to describe any White who they see as self-hating, having so-called \"White Guilt\", and voting Democrat, as well as any Conservative pushing a diversity agenda or so-called \"pandering\" as they see it. Seems like they have made themselves mainstream by the sound of things. Reading these comments, I can't help but wonder the hilarious and hypocritical irony behind this. As they use these terms, I wonder if these are the same people who take issue when minorities use the term \"Uncle Tom\" for the pretty much the exact same reasons they use those words for. If so, they need some self-reflection. Furthermore, the fact that they get offended by terms such as \"Uncle Tom\" and other similar terminology like \"coon\", \"Oreo\", \"coconut\" goes against their beliefs that the Left are snowflakes who want to be politically correct.

      "I've participated in many debates concerning abortion, and one thing that all pro-lifers, and even many pro-choicers seem to agree on, is that abortion is a tragic loss of life. But this argument doesn't make any sense to me if one presupposes that conscious experience is something that can only be formed in a living brain and that any conscious awareness that may exist in a ZEF would be of the most rudimentary variety.\n",

You would also have been spared any suffering that would inevitably arise as part and parcel of being a conscious entity. So abortion prevents all the bad, without really imposing the loss of the good (because the 'good' was never desired to begin with, and a corpse can no more desire the goods of life than any other clump of inanimate matter).\n",

      "As you'll have probably guessed, my mother chose not to have an abortion.

And society broadly tells me that I'm insane if I'd want to end this drudgery in favour of a return to the harmlessness of non-existence, and then claims that because I'd have to be certifiably insane not to want to endure another several decades of this, they need to act in my best interests by preventing me from accessing some lethal drug or gas that would end my suffering instantly and without pain.

They are about complimenting each other's differences as well preventing boredom with eachother.  Ron and Hermione together were a fountain of drama.   Harry and Hermione together were calmer and more forgiving.   They were of similar character being hardworking, serious, focused on the future, and altruistic.\n",

Who was more of a willful bad boy, Harry or Ron?   Clearly it was Ron.\n",

He could be really stupid sometimes, but he wasn't just plain stupid.  He had talent in chess and on the Quiddich pitch, but he had anxiety issues. He was flawed.

      "One common myth I see a lot of \"men's rights\" types (and even feminists every now and then) regurgitate is that the reason there are 6-7 times as many incarcerated men is that judges are unduly harsh towards men they sentence and/or unduly lenient to women. This is wrong.\n",

      "Men go to jail more because of behavioural differences between men and women at the population level. For one, men tend to have far more aggressive and confrontational personalities than women. While men are more predisposed to using verbal or physical aggression, women are more likely to utilise [relational aggression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_aggression), which is far more indirect and crucially does not involve any kind of criminal act.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor here is that men on average are more willing to make reckless life choices for the prospect of a reward and are harder to deter with the threat of negative consequences. Women are known to be [more risk averse when it comes to things like finance](https://www.city.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2019/10/women-dislike-financial-risk-taking-research-finds) for example, so it's not hard to see why the prospect of jail time would have a greater effect on their behaviour.\n",

While men and women both feel anger to the same degree, [women are actually better at anger management than men](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97882&page=1), possibly due to differences in brain structure.

This term seems to be used to describe basically just about anyone that speaks up on behalf of the rights of others, particularly if that group is being persecuted. So, actually, good for anyone that does that. Caring about your fellow humans believe it or not is actually a 'good quality' and standing up for them is good too.

The bodily pain caused to that member is the real purpose of circumcision.** None of the activities necessary for the preservation of the individual is harmed thereby, nor is procreation rendered impossible, but violent concupiscence and lust that goes beyond what is needed are diminished. **The fact that circumcision weakens the faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes the pleasure is indubitable. For if at birth this member has been made to bleed and has had its covering taken away from it, it must indubitably be weakened. The Sages, may their memory be blessed, have explicitly stated: It is hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him.

      "These kinds of arguments have been made over and over to fuel the panic surrounding CRT but I challenge anyone to find a piece of legislation or proposed legislation to censor dissenting perspectives coming from the CRT side.  Getting “cancelled” on Twitter or private social media companies deciding what to allow is in no way comparable to actual laws that limit what teachers can and can’t talk about.  The “stop woke” bill in Florida is effectively no different from the Ministry of Truth in 1984.  The accusation is constantly thrown around that proponents of CRT try to silence their critics by calling them racists.  However I only see the opposite happening.  Multiple states are passing laws outlawing the teaching of any material related to CRT based on the accusation that it is “anti white racism”.  However that accusation is not fact but opinion.  Certainly it is the opinion of the Harvard School of Law where CRT was developed that it is not anti white racism but rather a critical analysis of the ways systemic racism is perpetuated and interacts with the law.  If the anti-CRT side feels so confident that their views concerning systemic racism are correct than why are they making opposing viewpoints illegal?  That makes it look like they know they are wrong and are threatened by the truth.  The whole point of education is to be exposed to diverse perspectives and form your own opinion using critical analysis.  I read “The Communist Manifesto” in high school history, that doesn’t mean I was being indoctrinated into Communism.  How can you expect students to be able to do this if you are outlawing and censoring all materials from perspectives you don’t agree with?  That sounds like actual indoctrination.\n",

It is in our interests for men to reject gender and gender roles, however, most men will redirect this blame onto women and feminism. Regardless, the underclass in any societal hierarchy should not make the suffering of the oppressing class their priority. Men need to accept and respect this fact.

      "So the majority of pushback I see on identifying as \"x-American\" comes from people who fundamentally misunderstand it, mostly due to some bad apples. I'll just say it upfront: identifying as \"x-American\" is not the same as identifying as x. Being x-American doesn't make you a spokesperson for x. I agree that the people who do that are very disrespectful, but that's not what this is. \n",
      "\n",

      "Take Irish-Americans, for example. We've got our own history of our ancestors coming over from the famine in Ireland to climb out of poverty in the face of anti-Catholic discrimination. Is that story American? Yes. But that's not something that people with ancestry in the Mayflower or Japan can claim as their own, despite them also being as  American as I. But it doesn't stop there! We've got our own heroes, like the Irish Brigade of the Civil War. We have our own movies like \"Gangs of New York\" or \"Boondock Saints\". We have our own music, like the Dropkick Murphys. \n",

And it's the same with Italian-Americans, Greek-Americans, or what have you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why is this something important to Americans? Because we all grow up learning about how our ancestors came from somewhere else. Whereas people in other (non-former colonial) countries can figure their ancestors probably lived in the same general area for centuries, Americans know their ancestors have only been American for max a few centuries - and in many cases not that much. So, we Americans naturally want to know which story our ancestors come from. It's melting pot culture. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's important, too. Historically, much of the absolute worst of racism has come from groups who try to assert themselves as \"true Americans\". That's where you get shameful histories like the KKK of the 1920's. It's telling that today's KKK portrays \"whites\" as true Americans. The concept of race is a completely artificial way of grouping people with little to nothing in common past their skin tone, but it's used to justify hate. \n",

      "Reminding people of their immigrant roots encourages them to distance themselves from identifying themselves as \"true, white Americans\" and excluding immigrants.

      "\n",
      "There had been a number of burglaries in the McMicheals neighborhood and Arbery was known to the neighborhood and the police as a burglary suspect. He had been seen and caught on camera going through a house-under-construction multiple times in the middle of the night.\n",

      "----\n",

      "They didn't shoot him because he was black. They didn't shoot him because they thought he was stealing. They shot him because he tried to grab Travis McMicheals shotgun and started punching him in the face. At that point, even if we assume the McMicheals and Rhoddie were absolutely wrong about everything before; It is completely unreasonable to say they should or could have done anything else other than defend themselves by shooting Arbery.\n",

      "With Roddie it's not even a question, all he did was follow, film, and call the police. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The McMichaels never actually attempted to detain Arbery. They never attacked, restrained, or pointed their weapons at him. They merely followed him whilst asking him to stop and talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the McMichael's absolutely had reasonable and probable grounds to suspect Ahmaud Arbery of committing felony burglary. This (should have) secured them the right to detain Arbery until police could arrive and investigate. They were lawfully open carrying firearms, an inviolable right recognized by the Second Amendment and entirely reasonable when detaining a suspected fleeing felon. Rather than stopping and waiting for law enforcement to arrive, Arbery attempted to wrestle a weapon from one of them. This escalated a \"detainment\" on suspicion of burglary to putting McMichaels in fear of imminent death under which use of deadly force is permitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, in the trial both the prosecution and defense agreed that whether anything they did was legal depends on whether they were justified in performing a citizens arrest. The Georgia citizens arrest law is just 2 sentences:\n",
      "\n",
      "*\"A private person may arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge. If the offense is a felony and the offender is escaping or attempting to escape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion.\"*\n",

      "The defenses interpretation makes sense; If it's a misdemeanor you need to have absolute certainty that a crime took place before you tackle someone to the ground. If it's a felony, and they are running away, you only need to have a reasonable suspicion that someone did something before you chase after them. Again this makes sense, it's not sensible for someone to detain a kid because they think he just shoplifted a box of cookies. It is sensible for someone to chase after a guy who looks like he just committed a murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prosecutions argument doesn't; They were arguing that you need 100% certainty of any crime and **also** 51% suspicion if it's a felony before you can perform a citizens arrest. \n",

They'll show some signs of genuinely wanting to do any of those things even if they have no intention of actually doing it.

Yes I’m well aware that the legal grounds for making him leave was the 1,000 feet of a school, don’t waste your breath talking about it.  Something doesn’t have to be illegal to be creating a dangerous situation and a public nuisance.  The police identified him as a threat to public safety so they found a legal reason to make him leave, they didn’t come from the school they came from the courthouse.  They knew that Rittenhouse was instigating violence and creating a dangerous situation the night of the protest, they just didn’t care.  Rittenhouse got off because an incompetent prosecutor brought murder instead of manslaughter and because of the politics of the moment.

There was just no evidence, in a perfect world that isn't polarized and everything isn't political this case never makes it to trial. The first guy chased him and threatened to kill him, second guy assaulted him with a skateboard and the third guy was only shot AFTER he pointed his gun at Rittenhouse. That's important because the prosecution had nothing and he knew he had nothing but still had to do his job. His options were either A:Do legit nothing and just sit there, or B:Grasp at any straw he could I.E Call of duty, show the Jury how it feels to be on the other end of an AR15...etc. And I think he did a great job at grasping at straws, I mean the jury actually deliberated on it for more than a day, when I honestly thought it would take less than an hour at first. \n",

This provoked the other group as they intended, a fight started, and two were killed.

      "\n",
      "**So first of all, what are blockchains?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Blockchains are simply distributed ledgers and computing systems. Now those are two fancy words that essentially mean they are systems, spread across the globe, running on many computers and servers, that track data, as well as allow their users to perform any tasks defined within their specifications. This can be as simple as adding two numbers, or handling a *smart contract* that only pays out insurance money if certain requirements are met. We'll get back to these later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefit of having all the data, and code, running on a distributed system, is that everything is transparent. This doesn't always mean that I can read how much of a certain crypto got sent or received from each wallet, but the code can verify that you're allowed to perform certain transactions, and this is done by multiple people to ensure that trust doesn't need to really exist, since a large portion of people running and validating the network need to agree. This makes blockchains trustless.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How does crypto play into this?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Cryptocurrencies are coins or tokens built on top of blockchains. It's very important to understand the difference between a cryptocoin, and a cryptotoken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each blockchain needs a way to incentivize those distributed computers and servers I mentioned. Since they're running the computational tasks, and storing all the data on the ledger, they get paid in a cryptocoin. For the Bitcoin network this is BTC, for Ethereum it's ETH, etc. Those fees are usually paid when a transaction is ran on the network, so i.e. if I send from my wallet to yours some ETH, then a transaction fee must be paid and a part of which gets paid to the miners that enabled this transaction to go through, the rest of the transaction fee is destroyed, making ETH deflationary in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a lot more that can go into the economics of a cryptocoin, or token. Some of it I might bring up later. In any case, now to the tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tokens are representations of real-world assets, or completely digital assets, built on top of a blockchain. As they aren't used to pay transaction fees, and aren't built natively on the blockchain they reside on, we call them tokens instead of coins. This could even be something like a house deed, or the ownership certificate of a vehicle, etc. These tokens don't even need to only exist on one blockchain. They can be coded to exist on multiple, such as Solana, Ethereum and Cardano.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, not all blockchains make it possible to create a token on their network. Each blockchain has its own approach, often giving the creator of a token a reason to pick one or the other blockchain for their project.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How can tokens help us?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, a big use-case I see in blockchain technology right now is the use of tokens, which is why it's getting a dedicated section. As I mentioned, tokens are just assets, either representing something in the real-world, or entirely digital. I can tokenize my house deed, as I mentioned, or generate a bunch of even tickets with the right blockchain. Then sell the whole thing digitally, in a trustless and low-fee manner compared to traditional centralized systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are just some examples I wanted to quickly mention on how tokens can actually have real-world use. On top of that, think about the games we play. LoL accounts, among others, can be sold for thousands of dollars because of the items they possess. Now, some might call it a bubble, or simply dumb, but it shows, that we humans are capable of attributing arbitrary value, to the oddest of things. The same can be seen in certain artwork (IMO, but those buying the art probably see it in a very different light) and playing cards for soccer/football or Pokémon.\n",
      "\n",
      "All those, more playful, systems, can be tokenized and gamified on blockchain as well. I can write a smart contract that generates a very specific set of cards, which are used in a PvP game, and the better a card's attributes are, the higher likelihood it has in winning a tournament. That's a very basic, and general example of what I'm trying to explain, but hopefully it makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What are smart contracts?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Smart contracts are what really make blockchains as capable as they are today, IMHO. A very straightforward explanation is that a smart contract is some code, that only does something when certain parameters are met. That's why it's called a smart contract, because it only executes its main task, after the contract is signed so to speak. Depending on the blockchain you're working on, smart contracts will have different capabilities, but there are some crazy use-cases for them that I bet some of you will find interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is where we get a bit more technical. To really understand how great a smart contract can be, you need to know that this code gets deployed on a blockchain by whoever created it, and gets a wallet address of its own just like you or I would on which it can accept transactions or even send them. This means smart contracts can interact with the crptocoins and tokens I mentioned earlier. A smart contract can also keep track of data, kind of like an Excel sheet on the blockchain, that is fully transparent and open. It's trustless, like I said, because you can view the code before interacting with it, to ensure that it truly will do what its creator claims it should.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because smart contracts have the capabilities I mentioned above, they can be used to validate the authenticity of certain assets. As I mentioned above, those gaming cards would be created by a smart contract, and since the smart contract only does exactly what it's told to do, people can verify that the card is real, by checking if its original creator was the smart contract that runs the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, smart contracts can be used for more than just games. They can be used for voting, open and publicly ran insurances, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), liquidity and swapping protocols, lending protocols, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "All those get even more technical. A decentralized autonomous organization, is exactly what it sounds like. A company that doesn't have a CEO, or anyone running its operations. Everything that happens in that company is executed via code. If the smart contract is supposed to change, to e.g. support new features or use-cases, then people would first have to vote on it. The voting systems are always different as well, but a popular example is MakerDAO, which created its own token that people can hold to get voting rights. So essentially anyone can make business decisions by holding the token. This is a popular approach in crypto governance in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liquidity, swapping and lending protocols have to do with DeFi. DeFi stands for decentralized finance, and is a whole new world of taking over the tasks from traditional banks, and putting them on the blockchain. Instead of earning interest through the middleman, who takes a cut, you add your liquidity to a liquidity pool on the blockchain, and make far higher returns. This can even be done with stablecoins, which are essentially coins or tokens pegged to a fiat currency value, so you don't have to worry about the volatility of crypto.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swapping protocols allow people to trade between currencies without a middleman as well. Instead of a centralized exchange buying millions of crypto so that they have the liquidity when you want to buy it, a DEX (decentralized exchange) will use smart contracts to have the community pool this liquidity, and anyone that adds liquidity, just like with the above mentioned lending protocols, makes a good amount of fees for the risk and effort. I must add that the risk is usually extremely low with well-established DEXes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I could go on about crypto all day. But the last two things I want to mention, is that crypto really could help some third-world countries, but even first-world countries in a meaningful way. The Cardano developers have been partnering with African nations to introduce better ways in tracking education data, voting turnouts, etc. using blockchain. These systems will be somewhat closed, as they probably will be ran by the government, but they will be leveraging the same blockchain technology we see here in the public system.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, there are blockchain projects working on early implementations of UBI. If we can ensure that everyone only signs up to said blockchain once, then we can pay out a certain basic income rate which is something some first-world countries direly need in this time of automation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Touching on the Metaverse.**\n",

I think it's interesting, and again, just like traditional games are able to put certain value on items, the Metaverse wants to build a decentralized digital world. So whether you like it or not is up to you, but it's kind of like playing VRChat on steroids. Along with the financial incentives, people are just going to do what they can to get in early.

      "**Wrapping up.**\n",

      "I will admit, blockchain tech, and crypto, still has a long ways to go as of right now. There are some great projects out there building on some awesome ideas, but it's worth nothing that Ethereum still runs on PoW, which uses a fair bit of energy. Luckily, most modern blockchains use PoS, which doesn't, and Ethereum 2.0 will be migrating to it. There are other concerns, such as interoperability, and centralization, that will need to be addressed by projects, to bring crypto into the mainstream.

      "This would have been true at the start of the crypto and in particular, Bitcoin, mining phase. People were spending insane amounts of money on mining farms, GPUs, wasting energy and such, but things have changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, [Bitcoin mining, while still a thing, is running on nearly 60% green energy, a number that's only increasing.](https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/use-of-green-energy-in-bitcoin-mining-jumped-to-56-in-june-quarter-report-11625212165534.html) That makes it one of the main industries that primarily relies on clean power sources and is on a trajectory of becoming carbon neutral, while many other applications that waste a lot more power are still stuck on coal and nuclear energy. Not only that, Bitcoin mining actually gets most of its energy from excess produced in countries such as Iceland which means no one is being denied renewable energy since no one actually seems to care to use it except miners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second point. Bitcoin mining is one of the few wasteful consensus strategies still being used at a larger scale. Other, more modern currencies, such as SOL, XMR, ETH, DOT, etc. use proof of stake mechanisms to validate transactions, which can be ran with very little energy and actually still are profitable for retail investors. Bitcoin mining is only profitable if you run ASICS in a large server farm and have cheap energy and infrastructure fees.\n",

      "There are cryptos that still run on proof of work validation mechanisms, or even some more exotic file-based ones that ruin hard drives.

Stores online already offer incentives for using BTC, Tesla even accepts it as a payment method, while Twitter is adding it for their rewards scheme. Even Reddit now has a token on the Ethereum network to handle their premium memberships and community rewards. Check out the Reddit vault if you haven't yet. For mobile users it's in the side menu below your settings and profile menu options. The underlying blockchain technology used by crypto can be used for even more decentralized apps, such as content sharing networks, Solana already has dapps designed for artists, while DAAG is working on their decentralized stock exchange network on Solana as well, and the potential is nearly limitless.\n",

      "So yeah, as I said. I don't want anyone to use this post as an incentive to buy crypto. I'm not saying you should. But please, inform yourself if you are going to criticize it, and use valid point. Crypto is a polarizing topic, so a lot of misinformation is spread on a daily basis and headlines are designed to infuriate some while exciting others. That's just how the news works. But crypto has a technical nature, which makes it easy to examine with an objective point of view. Make use of that and start making informed decisions about your finances instead of getting angry at the system and not doing anything about it. This is your chance to be independent from some of the biggest and most unethical institutions out there.\n",

With all that outta the way, if a prank is physically harmless and/or mild, there's no fucking need to get all up and arms about it, just let the prank be, don't forgive the prankster if it really hurt that much and move the fuck on. Like, unless said criteria applies in the prank, when you react very hostile, you're kinda making the prankster look like the innocent one in their moment and turnint the situation from a personal to a very serious one in public. That's all I got to say for this post.\n",

      "In Christian theology, we are all sinners, bound for hell because of our wicked ways. Thankfully, Jesus died, and for some reason, that means if we accept him as our saviour, our souls are saved. This is true no matter what you've done. You could've spent your life persecuting Christians, murdering, raping, molesting, any of the most evil crimes, but if you ask Jesus Christ for forgiveness and to be your saviour, you're heaven bound by his mercy.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one thing common in all the variants of Christianity I've seen is that fetuses, incapable of getting baptized or asking for forgiveness, go to heaven if they die, be it by miscarriage or abortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this, we have two simple facts: if you, a non-Christian, get an abortion, you're no less hell-bound than if you didn't, so there's really no effect on where you'll end up, and if you later become Christian, you'll be going to heaven either way. Meanwhile, if you're aborted, you're definitely going to Heaven, while if you're born, there's a high chance, something like 68% if I recall, that you won't be Christian and will end up going to hell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, it's pretty clear: abortion is a net good. You're vastly reducing the fetuses chance of going to Hell and guaranteeing it heaven, at no cost to the mortal soul of the mother. The most objective good would be for a mother to have as many abortions as possible, as this creates the greatest number of souls that get to go to heaven and experience bliss, before eventually asking for forgiveness. Hell, even if God gets annoyed at this loophole and refuses to forgive the woman, one soul going to Hell for the dozens of aborted souls going to heaven far outweighs the cost.\n",

It was such a good year that even something as bad as, \"M.I.L.F.S\" by Fergie(a song that did chart)has this awesome moment in it when the song changes into sounding like one of those high energy gospel songs and she starts belting at the top of her lungs.

Neutral media can't exist just because they must think about  what news should be covering and about what to talk. But this is only a little problem comparing to the fact that all our opinions is from our environment. Nearly all people that was raised during times of kings were monarchists (and even when they not it is only was because of some revolutionary leaders) , nearly all people that was raised during Soviet Union were communists, nearly all people that lived in Germany of 1932-1945 years were fascists.  Your opinions is not your opinions, it is product of your environment. But exist a small amount of free minds (i think this is not more than 1% of people) who have their own and independent view about the world and who is primarily force of changes in the world. And no, i am not believing that i obe of those people, and be fair, with a near the 100% you are also not on of those people. Even when your opinion is not mainstream it is with high chance just a product of your charachter, not the mind, you can have a instinctive love to rebellion because you love to think you are smart or \"not like other people\". Or you just hate people(fascism), jealous for rich(communism), fear of changes(conservatism), like to think you are bringing good and freedom to this world(liberalism) etc. No matter what are you believing right now, nearly 100% this is not from your rational mind, but from feelings and environments.

      "This will be the most controversial post and view Reddit will have. But to be honest, throughout my research and gathering of this process... I am willing to accept every outcome headed my way.\n",
      "\n",
      "After looking around at r/HermanCainAward, especially with it's growth (whether by the recent articles or not), as a fond person of researching I decided to tackle the claims the people make that say that sub is bad because it celebrates death. This is accompanied by them stating that it breaks the rules of Reddit. Mainly Rule 1. So in order to tackle these claims, I present to you this post.\n",
      "\n",
      "First let's go over, **Rule 1**\n",
      "\n",
      ">Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. ***Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.***\n",
      "\n",
      "[Inciting violence](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513151) and [the hate sections](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045715951) have hyperlinks in them so they can provide examples in terms of context.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what people who dislike the sub form their basis on breaking ToS. This rule thanks to it's last section on both grounds. So now let's dissect them one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, **inciting violence**. To incite by definition [thanks to webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/incite#:~:text=transitive%20verb,up%20%3A%20spur%20on%20%3A%20urge%20on), it is to encourage, urge, or stir up. Is the sub encouraging Anti-Vaxxers to die? No, absolutely not. The majority of the posts are post screen caps which critique anti-vaxxers and showcase how COVID disinformation kills. The posts with the caps are catalogued in chronological order, starting from people believing in disinformation about COVID to either their demise or their realization. How is basing something off of a poster showcasing another persons history \"inciting violence\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the easiest to debunk. How easy? Is the OP of the post voicing their opinion of them? No. It's just their history. The fact they have no thoughts about the person and that they are showcasing the person's life is not encouraging violence. If that's the case, most history subs would be banned\n",
      "\n",
      "If you still don't believe me, go into any of the posts and look at the criteria I posed. As in look back at that same webster definition and see if it applies to comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus consider the second rule of that sub, which is \"don't root for nominees to be awarded\". If that comment is inciting, the mods will report it and take it down because that's wishing death, promoting it, which is against Reddit's rules. They know that comments that promote death can get banned, plus [considering the nature that this sub doesn't want to exist but because of them are anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/HermanCainAward/comments/psyp4w/for_those_who_say_the_hca_are_immoral_lets_see/), it's right for them to do to enforce that rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, **hate based on identity**. How Reddit identifies hate by identity falls under these categories and I quote;\n",
      "\n",
      ">based on their actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability. These include victims of a major violent event and their families. \n",
      "\n",
      "This other bad faith argumentation of the sub is on the grounds of their own political identity, because apparently it is now a political side. This is tricky to dissect. While one could argue political identity being a part of the many examples of hate on identity, I argue against that.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we want to go further into this let's look at the possible counter-argument, [did you know that companies can deny you because of your political beliefs?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomspiggle/2021/02/24/is-political-discrimination-in-the-workplace-legal/?sh=7778d88c68dd) [This extends more to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.](https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964) This would be a no-shit moment if you've been banned in political subs where your ideals are different from the majority but this is reality. That is not the case with here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not? If I am honest, while I can make a case that a company denying a person thanks to their political views is discrimination, in a case like this subreddit and other related areas to it, it's very different.\n",
      "\n",
      "One is a job that require humans to work for to ensure their livelihood, the other is just a club with no purpose. One is about working for change for your right to paycheck, the other is goofing off. You see? One is client to client for their needs, the other is just not about the needs and is only one-party.\n",
      "\n",
      "That sub is that other. It's not providing needs to other people out of necessity. Jobs vs subs are very different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also for the main meat to connect this; political identity's change over time as we grow and develop new takes on situations, one idea today could be a bad one later. Political affiliations swing from human to human as we get older or we get exposed to new identity's. To put it bluntly, the things Reddit listed such as race, identity, gender, sex, disability are all things we can't change. Political affiliation we can change. So why discriminate when we can change affiliations?\n",
      "\n",
      "The virus has no political sides, this virus took the left and the right, even some anti-vaxxers are left wings too but very very rarely is that the case. Even if the majority is the opposition, it's not hate because you can change it. If you can't change it and that's your personality/life/body, it's hate. That's in layman's terms Reddit provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR: That sub **does not** violate Reddit ToS. The incitement is not there, and the hatred is non-existent. That sub is all a PSA about how disinformation in today's society can kill by showcasing a person's life. Call it a memorial, call it a scared straight message, but it isn't a place to dance at deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also I find it ironic that for people on Reddit who hate this sub (mainly some on the opposition) are also Free Speech Warriors. It's funny really, you claim to support Free Speech but be willing to ban this sub... That's funny.\n",

      "I think vegans get a lot of hate. Sometimes, it's for some crazy shit PETA is doing, but for the vast majority of times, it's clear people just enjoy getting annoyed or angry at vegans easier. It's never made sense to me. Veganism isn't a choice that effects other people. If anything, given veganism has less of an environmental impact, it's considerably better for those around you to be vegan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, the anger persists. Why? Well, it's pretty simple. People feel insecure, because they're aware that meat-eating is the ethically worse option. Meat-eating is unhealthier, it hurts the environment and it leads to all that disgusting, sadistic shit that we put animals through. And, let's be honest... at this point, we're all aware of that fact. The evidence is so overwhelming that anyone who denies veganism is better is just doing some premium coping, and it's honestly so pathetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to eat meat, feel free. People make bad choices all the time, that's human nature. I don't particularly care either way. It's the weakness I see in a lot of meat-eaters that annoys me. The inability to just be strong and stand by the choices you make, rather than having to lie and pretend you're not picking the worse option. It's like a smoker trying to still argue \"Smoking actually helps, look at this study from the 1860s!\" Honestly, it's embarrassing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and not that it's relevant to the opinion, but I'm not a vegan. Meat is absolutely delicious, especially in a nice BBQ. I'm about to eat some pulled pork in a sandwich right now. I recognize veganism as the better option, but so is not smoking when I drink, and I don't do that either. We're all only human.\n",
