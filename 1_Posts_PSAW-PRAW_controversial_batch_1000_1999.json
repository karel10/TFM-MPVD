just use it in different ways. While the left uses it to discuss the oppression of different minority groups, the right uses it to \"own the libs\" and talk about how white people, Christians and men are oppressed. By using it to \"own the libs\", I'm talking about people on the right calling anyone who criticizes a black conservative a racist, saying that it's impossible for a minority who's a conservative to hold any racist views against their own group and tokenizing conservatives from different minority groups in order to do the \"black friend\" defense. They use \"white liberal\" as a pejorative and they often pick out anecdotal evidence of minorities who think that something white liberals consider bigoted isn't actually bigoted so they could call anyone who thinks it is a \"white savior\" and accuse them of \"getting offended on behalf of that minority group\"\n\nI am aware that when conservatives use identity politics to \"own the libs\", they think they're exposing liberal hypocricy. The problem is that this is often based on a misunderstanding of what we actually believe\n\nEdit: I acknowlege that there are some legitimate grievances with how men are treated and the expectations society places on them. But you don't oppose all identity politics if you have no problem with talking about them","1":"The entire republican party has completely disconnected from reality.\n\nTheir only beliefs are that of what they are told to believe by their media spheres and what they believe will attain them more political power. \n\nThe concept of bipartisanship does not exist anymore. Regardless of what type of legislation is put forth republicans vote solely based on what is in line with their party.\n\nThere are GOP members openly admitting that democracy is an issue. And after the 2020 election we got a sneak peak at how republicans do not care about democracy. 81% of republicans still believe the 2020 election was stolen. And the moment they gain power again in this country they will do everything in their power to dismantle the safe guards of our democracy. And they will do so under the guise that \u201cthey have to prevent the democrats from rigging elections again.\u201d\n\nThe republican party is following the exact same road Nazi Germany and every other far right government in history has. \n\nThey demonize higher education, they co-opt populists economic talking points to appeal to disenfranchised workers, they use minority groups as a scapegoat to institute more and more authoritarian laws, they do not believe in an objective reality or any sense of scientific truth, they demonize the media (they literally use the term \u201cfake news\u201d, a term used directly by the Nazi party\u201d), and they use nationalist rhetoric as a way to demonize their opposition because anyone who opposes you must inherently be anti American. \n\nAt this very point in time, we have open Nazis, white supremacists, and conspiracy theorists in government seats as part of the GOP.\n\nMTG and Bobbert are congresswomen and are open Q-Anoners\/nazis and believe in the great replacement conspiracy theory. And what has the GOP done about it? Nothing. We have MTG going to literal Nazi rallies hosted by literal Nazis, and giving speeches. \nWe have the wives of supreme court justices telling their husbands to overturn the 2020 election because she is a Q-Anoner and then having that husband vote against confirming the election results. \n\nYes, the democrat party is shit. And yes there are people in it that should not be in positions of power. But the worst thing you can accuse democrats of being is weak and ineffectual at properly addressing and combating the impending threat the GOP poses. \n\nThere will be a day very soon in which the United States falls to these people. A day in which radicalized right wingers fueled by years of intense directed misinformation kill democrat politicians, and the republican party will refuse to condemn the actions. And when it does I hope all the minorities and liberals in this country have decided to get over their fear of guns and decide to have ways of protecting themselves using their 2nd amendment right. \n\nI do not intend this post to change anyones mind. As anyone who votes republican at this point in history is no longer swayed by reality. However I leave this post here so when this all does happen I can at the very least take a fat shit on the heads of all the liberals and centrists who prescribed to this phony sense of bipartisanship.

Nobody else complained. And in this day of age, everyone is talking, sharing their experiences with abusers. I wonder why nobody else said anything? Not even for a paycheck? It's because Johnny Depp is respected (and possibly innocent but I won't say for sure though since I wasn't there). \n\nAll Johnny does is make some dope ass movies and turn up. \"Yeah a lot of people drink\/smoke\/do drugs in Hollywood!\", yeah but how many of them are this lowkey?\n\nJohnny doesn't look for popularity or for media fame, he doesn't go to clubs and bars going wild and making highlights.

Wouldn't that be just as good as Roe v Wade, or  maybe even stronger?\n\nI guess I'm  confused, if this is the majority opinion surely nothing is really going  to change all that much.

I think there are plenty of steps one could have taken before it having to come to abortion. \n\nMany women use the argument \"it's my body so it's my choice\". But it's not only your body, it's also the body of your unborn child that is effected. Both your rights and that of your unborn baby should be taken into account when making this decision and I think when making such a decision the right of the (unborn) child to live should carry more weight. \n\nBut you are not ready to have a baby? Maybe you should have thought of that beforehand! Use condoms and other forms of birth control. And yes, I am aware that there is still a residual chance of both the condom and birth control failing. And that's a risk you can either accept, or you should avoid having heterosexual intercourse all together. And I don't mean this as an argument against sex. I mean that so many things in life carry risks that we can only accept. When we get in our car or on our bike, we have a chance that we die in a traffic accident. Just as much as having sex means there is a risk that 9 months later, a little miracle will happen. \n\nAlso, I think any decision on what the maximum period to have an abortion is, is completely arbitrary. What is the difference between say 6 weeks or 6 months? Or 6 months vs 9 months? Why does a baby that is almost fully grown have more right to live than a baby that's just conceived? \n\nPlus, I think people should really take more consideration at the option of adoption. Anonymous if you have to.  An argument I often hear against that is that adopted children have a higher chance of becoming a dropout or a criminal and those are sad statistics. But at least those children got a chance to do something better with their lives and there are plenty of stories out there of people who grew up without their parents and who still did something great with their life!\n\nI admit there are situations like when rape was involved, or when the life of the mother is in danger that are ethically more challenging and I could certainly understand if we keep special exceptions for those situations. But that's only a small percentage of all abortions out there.\n\nI would like to add that I'm against those people who protest outside of abortion clinics. I think christian extremists like that just give the pro life movement a bad name. As protesting extremists in any movement destroy the image of their movement these days. \n\nI would like to say I do not live in the United States. But what's happening there right now I do feel like people have a bad opinion on people who are pro life.

Not only have I lost my scapegoat, but now I feel embarrassed that I don\u2019t know what this \u201canti-Semitism\u201d is. Turns out it\u2019s the belief that Jewish people are inherently bad and that they run the world through various conspiracies.  Moreover, anti-Semitism can have horrific consequences. Turns out some guy named Hitler started a group called the Nazis. The Nazis systematically murdered over six millions Jews in the 1940s during something call \u201cthe Holocaust\u201d. How awful! \n\nI feel so stupid! I fell for a hateful lie. And there\u2019s no way that Soros can be a Nazi, he is Jewish! Agh! I\u2019m embarrassed! And I might have to go back to believing in that horrible climate change! \n\n**Disinformation:** ***There was no Holocaust.*** ***It was made up by Jews like Soros as part of their agenda to take over the world.*** \n\nWait, what?! Have I been fooled again? There was no Holocaust?\n\nLet me think about this for a bit\u2026.yeah, sounds good. If there was no Holocaust, I can go back to blaming George Soros for all the things I don\u2019t like. Moreover, I can add all \u201cJews\u201d as a stand in for Soros. He\u2019s just one guy that I\u2019ll probably never meet but I know that there are Jews in my town. Perhaps I can let them know about how I feel about their nefarious plot to take over the world. And, there are lots of other people in my town that I have never felt comfortable about too. Some of them are men who have sex with men, some of them speak Arabic and some Spanish. Yuck. \n\nBut guess what? Turns out Soros (and all Jews) support something called \u201cCultural Marxism\u201d which is designed to make people feel bad about their natural affinity for people of their own heritage and to undermine Western civilization through support for immigration and undermining traditional values. \n\nMakes sense to me! \n\nThis is just a primer but you get the idea!

Tibet separatist movement  does not have any broad support, and is a fringe movement of wholesum  religious extremists. Tibet does not have a big population, and it would  decrease further after succession, and would struggle to fight back or  even just use its resources effectively. I am not going into how China leveraged its infrastructure to improve Tibet's wealth, since one may argue their resources could afford even more wealth. I personally don't agree with that argument.\n\nEven if it was a good idea, supporting it is not. If you are an American  basketball player or a Hollywood star, supporting this cause means you  either believe your own country is a utopia and there are no problems  with it currently, or (more likely) you deliberately chose a cause so  distant and impractical to appear radical without doing jack, then got  offended that another country can use tools to ensure its national interests. Practical implementation of Free Tibet would largely  distabilise, militarise and further turn Asia and the world away from  democracy. Of course, American military will help it become freer than it even dreamt to be, then leave to watch a country with hostile neighbors, armed religious fundamentalists and no tradition of democracy  turn into a chaotic wasteland. \"Well, who would have guessed?

The part that is completely false is \u201cwomen choose sexual partners based solely on physical features\u201d. NOT ALL women choose partners based on looks, some do but, the statement is still false. The argument I hear a lot from guys who DM me is \u201cwomen only want a 6\u2019 Chad\u201d; when I tell them it is simply not true they ignore it & move straight to insults. The reason I know this is not true is because I am married to a man who is not 6 feet tall. My sister is dating a man who isn\u2019t 6 feet tall. Plenty of other women are living proof that a man doesn\u2019t have to be ridiculously tall to get a girlfriend.\n\nNow back to the Black Pill argument, not all women choose sexual partners based only on looks. Also, \u201clooks\u201d is very subjective, one woman can find a person attractive, and another can think they are unattractive. Yes, looks matter. But it\u2019s an unsound inference to go from this experiment to the conclusion that \u201call women judge all men primarily and forever on the basis of their appearance\u201d. I don't think these men are as ugly as they claim they are, it's just a way to keep this blackpill-narrative and blame women instead of taking a hard look at the mirror and see how much time they've wasted on this instead of growing as a person. If they think women, 51.1% of world population, are personally against them, maybe the problem isn't women. Growing just needs to happen outside of the comfort-zone. If you turn down a date you might get called a bitch. If you have sex on a first date you might get called a slut. If you get in a fight with your boyfriend because he\u2019s a dickbag, you might get called a whore. I\u2019ve been called a slut for not having sex with someone I did not want to have sex with.

You don't get to say 'well I'm poor, so USA should let me immigrate'. There's a lot of cheap housing and decent jobs in Texas that I would kill (metaphorically) to go to. Like sure, my life is better than a lot of people, but I'm also worse off. Does that mean anyone worse off is allowed to go to the 'better' place?\n\nArguments on the basis of 'immigrants have a hard life, therefore deserve to enter US\/France\/Britain\/whatever country' is not a convincing argument at all.\n\nWe can argue 'well why do you get to immigrate but others don't.' Because, unfortunately, that's the way it is. If no borders existed, I am sure we'd be a lot more violent. Yes, borders create war. But imagine if it was full blown. Seriously. I have no doubt that without borders, without some sort of check as to who goes in and out. We'd have a lot more chaos.\n\nSorry, but there are 700 million people in poverty. If everyone was given citizen ship to usa alone, at least 25% i bet would accept. And that is a recipe for disaster.\n\nSaying 'I want a better life' is not the only reason a country SHOULD accept you.\n\nWhy people think saying some people shouldn't immigrate in, or there should be reduction as monstrous is beyond me.","50":"Sorry for the rambling title, but it will become clearer with examples.\n\nExample 1: Critical Race Theory\n\nThe Left is advocating for discussions in schools about racial equity (\"equality of outcome\" which is different from equality of opportunity), labeling entire demographics as \"oppressor versus oppressed\",  and teaching that the very foundation of this nation (the US) is rooted in racism and that the system is irredeemable. This is a divisive ideology which creates tension between friend groups, makes children suspicious of one another, and is only a THEORY as to explain the inter-group dynamics in this country. It involves taking every claim of oppression at its word and deferring to individuals' view of their own oppression rather than assessing data to assess whether the claim is actually true... and taught to young, impressionable children. \n\nAnyone who is opposed to this is told they \"oppose teaching American history.\" They are painting opposition to something extreme as opposition to something reasonable, to make it look like the other side is simply against teaching history and is heavily invested in maintaining racism. They do this to sneak extreme elements into the curriculum. This is not true. I learned American history in schools and about its atrocities. I learned about the Slave Trade, the Civil Rights movement, the Trail of Tears... I understood at a young age that these things were wrong and that as a society we need to treat one another with kindness and move forward. That is not what they are pushing for now, which is a very dulled-down version of CRT which teaches that the system is irredeemable and certain demographics are \"oppressors.\" \n\nExample 2: The Florida parental rights in education bill.\n\nThe Left is suggesting that this bill is designed to \"prevent students from knowing that LGBTQ+ people exist\" and that the goal is to prevent children from discussing their families, and \"to prevent against teaching LGBTQ+ history\" (here we go with history again)! \n\nIn reality, this bill is designed to prevent incidents such as this ([https:\/\/www.news-press.com\/story\/news\/education\/2022\/05\/05\/cape-coral-florida-teacher-casey-scott-fired-discussion-sexual-orientation-pansexual-lgbtq-flags\/9649148002\/](https:\/\/www.news-press.com\/story\/news\/education\/2022\/05\/05\/cape-coral-florida-teacher-casey-scott-fired-discussion-sexual-orientation-pansexual-lgbtq-flags\/9649148002\/)).\n\nThis teacher claims that students asked her questions about her sexual orientation, she answered that she was pansexual, explained what that meant, and then gave an assignment for the students for their next art project which involved designing a pride flag for their own sexual orientation, which was subsequently hung on the wall. This teacher not only told students who and what she is attracted to, which is entirely inappropriate, but encouraged them to reveal their own sexual orientation in a way that she, the entire class, and the entire school would know about it. IT IS ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR ADULTS TO DISCUSS THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION WITH CHILDREN.\n\nOther examples include teachers telling kindergarteners that they \"don't need to pick their gender yet\" and telling them that the American flag is a symbol of imperialism and forcing them to pledge allegiance to the LGBTQ+ flag instead. \n\nBut opposition to this bill is painted as \"being against acknowledging that LGBTQ+ people exist.\"","51":"I think this would get me flamed but I really hate how our culture has made bars and restaurants the default dating place for singles. I prefer that it's set in gyms because that is where most physically attractive people are at, a number one factor in a relationship, which would consequently force you to judge a person's personality more. So win-win. Hate how people consider dating in gyms \"creepy\" and \"perverted\" as if bars are any better with the amount of alcohol around lol.","52":"People don't like it, but that doesn't mean it isn't true. Yeah, it sucks that there's no magical objective 'ought'. We SHOULD have the right to be free. But doesn't mean we will always have this 'right'. The concepts expressed in 'rights' isn't something inherent, nor static. They are subject to change. There's no magic that somehow ensures you have the 'right to guns' or whatever. And I am a very big gun supporter. It's just I hate it when people use dumb arguments.\n\nI'm just really confused when people act like there is some sort of 'inherent right'. The law states that abortion is a right. If that changes, I'm not arguing 'but it's my right'. It's a tautology or something. If it stops being the law, then it is no longer a right. It should be. But the argument can't be 'it's a right' when it longer is. That just doesn't make sense.\n\nPeople mistake my view that it's not a right as in 'so you think it's ok to own slaves?' No, it's not ok, but it's not a right in the past. It is a right now and I'd like to keep it that way, but if we changed, I'm not arguing that some 'right' exists.\n\nI'm not arguing what should or shouldn't be, but rather what is or isn't. We should be free, but that doesn't mean that there is an objective 'ought'. That is is a fact we are to be free. ","53":"\nWho honestly and truly wants to wait until they\u2019re that old?\n\nA few years ago I was talking to a friend who was in a relationship (still going strong \ud83d\ude44) about how annoying being single is.

In the video you can clearly see him running at Chappell onstage and pushing him, knocking Dave off balance after stumbling himself.    He doesn\u2019t attempt to strike Dave and no weapon is ever brandished.  Security moves in and two members of the team immediately take control of the suspect, at that point the threat is neutralized.\n\nPhotos of the subject show his face swollen with multiple bruises and bleeding.  His arm is clearly badly broken, twisted at an unnatural angle and the shoulder seems dislocated as well.  A video can be seen where a large crowd surrounds the man and takes turns stomping and kicking his head.  Dave Chappell, Jamie Foxx and Busta Rhymes all apparently joined in.\n\nMuch has been made of the odd gun\/knife the suspect allegedly had on him.  It is not visible in either video and could only have been found after he was restrained.  It seems just as likely that security planted it to try to justify their actions after the fact.","59":"Whenever I see the occasional vegan recipes on instagram I find them to look pretty tasty but the comment section has to be a shit storm.

This is wrong and disgusting.\n\nIf I called for Israeli citizens to be banned from buying property in my country, I would be smeared as an anti-semite. In fact if you replaced \"Russians\" with any other ethnic or national group you would most likely be called a racist bigot by these same western liberals.\n\nI don't care what you think of the war. Russians aren't collectively responsible for Putin's decisions. It's also worth noting that a lot of the ones celebrating this are from Britain and America, so it's not really in their interests to start holding citizens responsible for the actions of their governments.","63":"The misunderstanding of what it means to be an \"empath\" is a lot like the misunderstanding of what it means to be \"gifted.\" Sometimes it's just a label people use to be \"different\" or \"quirky,\" but it is a real phenomenon whose name is often misused and abused.\n\nAnd no, it isn't always a good thing. People say \"Oh you have extra intelligence\/empathy, that's always a good thing!\" No it isn't. You don't understand. Extra intelligence comes with tons of problems: perfectionism, pressure from family, hidden mental issues like ADHD. Too much empathy can make people lose sleep worrying about people all the way on the other side of the globe. Too much empathy can lead you to cling to those who leech off your care and give you nothing in return out of the urge to \"fix their lives.\"\n\nI wrote this because I personally know someone who fits the definition of \"empath.\" Hearing about someone else's hardship makes her feel severely depressed. Hearing any bad news causes her to lose sleep worrying about people she doesn't even know. She also has a sort of urge to \"fix the person's life,\" and it crushes her when she can only help to a point (e.g. suggesting therapy to someone who doesn't want it). She avoids almost all social contact because she is worried someone will casually drop that their spouse was abusive, or their brother is in jail, or their friend died in a car crash. She tries to avoid the news, but sometimes gives in to the urge to go on the internet. She knows she can't just fix everyone's life, but she cannot control what she feels.\n\n(I know she needs therapy, but she won't go because she doesn't think it will help. She says she is perfectly fine with her hermit life. I can't force her to go, but I do my best to help and support her.)\n\nIt makes me furious that my friend's stress, and worry, and depression, and sleepless nights are being discounted because close-minded and ignorant people think \"extra empathy can only be a good thing!\"","64":"[deleted]","65":"[removed]","66":"With the recent Supreme Court leak in regards to Roe v Wade (which was in itself a politically motivated undermining of that storied institution) we have seen leftists and Democrats coming out of the woodwork to question and delegitimize the authority of the Supreme Court of the United States. As the Supreme Court is one of the three pillars upon which the government of the United States is built, any effort to delegitimize or question the authority of that branch can be interpreted as nothing short of an attack on democracy and the very foundation of this nation. Democratic politicians are threatening to pack the court with their obedient stooges, while protests in front of the court building have already turned violent. Even further, we have fringe leftist radicals threatening to dox Justices and MUCH worse. Apparently, all of the bellowing about \"threats to democracy\" after Jan 6th was just hot air, because it seems to be clear that the left and Democrats have no issues whatsoever in attempting to dismantle and delegitimize the very foundations of our government when they don't get their way. And after the summer rampage of violence of 2022 that burned minority communities across the US, this should surprise no one.","67":"Yes, I'm well aware that rape accounts for <1% of abortions. I'm also very big on taking responsibility for your actions, which would normally put me towards the pro life side, with an exception for rape, as I and most people could not conscionably force a rape victim to carry it to term.\n\nWhere I diverge is what I expect reality would be if we banned abortions with a rape exception. I have a pretty bleak view of human nature, and don't see this as a stretch in the slightest. Consider the following.\n\nA woman has voluntary sex and becomes pregnant. She wishes to abort. She then goes to a doctor, lies and says she was raped and is pregnant with a rape baby. We now have 2 possible scenarios.\n\nScenario 1. Take her word for it with nothing further and grant the abortion. If all it takes is a quick lie, I have no doubt virtually every abortion seeking woman would do so without hesitation, and the ban would be utterly ineffective.\n\nScenario 2. Who's the rapist? Report him to the police and press charges. Of course there is no rapist here, but she's desperate to get an abortion, so she'll accuse an innocent man. Not every woman would do this, maybe not even most, but there are nearly 900k abortions per year. If even 10% of women did this then that's 90k innocent men being charged, likely losing their jobs, paying thousands in legal fees, the stress, the stigma for the rest of their lives. And that's if they're not convicted. It's also billions of taxpayer money to fund these prosecutions, plus clogging up the justice system even more making things take even longer. Meanwhile the woman has gotten the abortion, because you can't wait for a year until the outcome of the trial to do it.\n\nThat's my thoughts on the matter, unpopular on the right because pro choice, unpopular on the left because women lie about rape.","68":"Freedom is a very powerful word, and it's included in the constitution of every single democratic country in the world. Freedom is seen in literature and media as the ultimate value and goal of everything. If you don't have freedom, do you have anything at all?\n\nHowever, does anyone really want a \"radical\" freedom? Let's look at some aspects of freedom.\n\n1. In the Soviet Union, during the reign of Stalin, the Soviet constitution stated, that it supports a multiparty system, and that if a group of people wanted to create a party, the state would support that. Reality, however, is *a bit* different. You have the freedom on paper, but not in practice.\n\n2. Radical freedom means to be free of the consequences of your actions. I technically have the freedom to go and slap my boss right now. But the consequences of that action are so punishing, that it's not real freedom is it. To be really free in that sense, would be to be free of the consequences of my actions. For an individual person in a vacuum, it's kinda cool to not face consequences. But do you want to live in a word, where *anyone* is free from consequences of their actions?\n\n3. Freedom often has rules. Think of driving a car. You're free to go wherever you want. But there are rules, such as driving on the right side of the lane, speed limits, traffic lights, areas where overtaking is not allowed, etc. Would you have more individual freedom if those rules were lifted? Yes. But it would have a disasterous effect on society as a whole.\n\n4. Freedom of speech. Truly a great thing. But what if the person exercising their freedom of speech is trying to gather support for a dictatorial and genocidal coup? Or just a regular genocide, where he wants to get rid of anyone belonging to group X. By granting that person their freedom of speech, we actually remove freedoms of people belonging to group X.\n\n5. Hypocrisy. In some states, the same republicans that preach the importance of freedom of speech, are banning school books containing \"uncomfortable\" topics. Clearly they too realize, that radical freedom is not a good thing.\n\n6. One or the other freedom. Some will argue that \"these days you can't say anything\", let's say about gay people. However, back in the early 2000s, unless you were in an extremely liberal metropolis, you couldn't talk about being gay. Something being \"gay\" was used as an insult. There was even a joke tweet about how wearing jeans that fit would get you labeled as a metrosexual. A gay person couldn't just come out. Compare to now, where apparently you can't be critical of gay people. If you had to choose between the freedom of being yourself, or freedom of speech, which one would you chose?\n\n7. A lot of people who are complaining about freedom of speech on reddit, are just complaining of being downvoted. This is a reaction of the community. If you meet with a group of friends and start talking shit about one of their partners, you will get backlash. Similarly, if reddit deletes your comment, you might feel like your freedom of speech is restricted. But imagine you go to a Magic the Gatheric game store and start talking about how magic the gathering sucks or even \"MTG is for cunts\". You'd get thrown out. There are absolutely time and place to talk about MTG, you can even say you don't like the game, or even better you can discuss the limitations of the game, and how it has changed during the years. My point is, there are constructive ways to express opinions, and there appropriate places to express opinions, and there always have been rules about how and what and when we should talk about.\n\nTL;DR: We never had radical freedom, and never will. And we're better off for it.","69":"[deleted]","70":"[deleted]","71":"I'm fairly new on Reddit but I discovered that I get downvoted for posts that are not offensive, rude or oponionated in a toxic way.\n\nI understand this made up rule wouldn't make sense on all subs (e.g. AITA) but definitely could be tried on r\/AskReddit.\n\nI'm not being childish - I simply want yo understand if I offended someone and how to prevent similar comments in the future or to apologise.","72":"[deleted]","73":"Abortion is one of the biggest get out of responsibility free cards you can play, right up there with bankruptcy.

All those moments you treasured, those bonds, that special feeling of love you have for your child, just...gone\n\nWhat kind of human being without a conscience would support the idea of taking a child's life away, just because \"you may not be ready\" for the task?\n\nIf you've never had a child, I'd be more sympathetic and understanding. But knowing what you'd be taking away from a baby, and still supporting it? Absolutely not! That would be like texting while driving, after losing a loved one to reckless driving. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong. What do you think?","77":"Abortion shouldn't have been legal to begin with.

The guy that they basically worship, Donald Trump, has engaged in cancel culture or called for people or companies to be cancelled many times before. When Ghostbusters(2016) came out, the people on the right who engage in culture war issues online showed just how pro free speech they are by harrassing Leslie Jones, one of the actresses in it, just because she chose to use her free speech by being in a movie they didn't like: [https:\/\/www.thecut.com\/2016\/08\/a-timeline-of-leslie-joness-horrific-online-abuse.html](https:\/\/www.thecut.com\/2016\/08\/a-timeline-of-leslie-joness-horrific-online-abuse.html).

But if something can be backed up with studies and statistics, is a part of the curriculum and is age appropriate and on topic, I think it's hypocritical for the people who are supposedly free speech absolutists to want to ban it","79":"[deleted]","80":"Yes I understand it can be a traumatic experience but it just baffles me why anybody would be scared to call the cops against their aggressor when it comes to rape. The longer you wait, the less believable you are and unless you are a sick nasty lying POS, then you know you are in the right. The sooner you report a rape the sooner that person can STOP raping other people as well. You may not like to hear this but you are being selfish by keeping it to yourself and not contacting the authorities. If you don\u2019t contact police and let it be, then the rapist will feel they have gotten away with it and do it again and is free go to rape more people. If you report then they go to jail and you don\u2019t have to worry about them anymore. It just boggles my mind when I see groups of victims claiming they\u2019ve been raped 15+ years ago, like why didn\u2019t you say anything before? You could\u2019ve prevented all the rape victims after you.\n\nEdit: you should report this immediately just like you would any other crime, an accident, break in, etc. why does rape have to be different unless they are hiding something.

Here's a couple sources: ([1](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/search\/research-news\/3415\/)) ([2](https:\/\/www.colorado.edu\/asmagazine\/2021\/09\/22\/study-shows-abortion-ban-may-lead-21-increase-pregnancy-related-deaths)) ([3](https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/think\/opinion\/abortion-rates-don-t-drop-when-procedure-outlawed-it-does-ncna1235174)).\n\nTherefore, by restricting access to safe abortions, anti-abortionism is driving safe abortions in medical settings underground into shady unsafe back alleys, which is causing more deaths than the 'babies' it is supposedly saving. Hundreds of women died in unsafe abortions before Roe v Wade ([4](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/2019\/05\/29\/planned-parenthoods-false-stat-thousands-women-died-every-year-before-roe\/)).\n\nIn fact, abortion rates are actually higher in high-income countries that restrict abortion compared to high-income countries that don't restrict abortions ([5](https:\/\/www.guttmacher.org\/fact-sheet\/induced-abortion-worldwide)). The only meaningful way to actually reduce abortions is by expanding access to contraceptives and sex education ([6](https:\/\/www.guttmacher.org\/report\/adding-it-up-investing-in-sexual-reproductive-health-2019)).\n\nBanning abortion also creates a hostile environment for women who miscarried, such as in this case ([7](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2022\/apr\/10\/texas-woman-murder-charges-dropped-self-induced-abortion)).\n\nStop calling anti-abortionists pro-life and start calling them pro-forced-birth or pro-sexual-control. Actual pro-lifers should be helping women get safe abortions and promoting the use of birth control and contraceptives.","82":"\"but what if the PHONE COMPANY could tell you what you can and can't say!!!\" is genuinely one of the dumbest arguments you can make. \n\nThe phone company is a natural monopoly. You only have one option of who runs a cable to your house. The point of common carrier laws is antimonopolistic. Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and every other social media site out there has many, many competitors that you may switch to.\n\nYou are not entitled to someone else's private property.","83":" \n\nEveryone knows that employment at-will is the concept that employer or employee  can terminate employment at anytime for any reason, including no reason  at all.\n\nI think that needs to be modified, because this is harmful to employees.\n\nFirst off, verbal-written-termination should be the universal disciplinary norm.\n\nWhat  I am suggesting: If an employer feels it is necessary to terminate an  employee, documentation needs to be provided. Examples:\n\n1. If  an employer wants to fire an employee for wearing a red shirt, the  employer needs to cite their company handbook that forbids red shirts  and document said employee wearing red shirt. Document verbal, written  warnings regarding wearing of red shirt.\n2. If  an employer feels the need to take away the jobs of other employees for  economic reasons, document projected P&L showing how financial  situation will improve ONLY by taking away jobs. It's stupid to lay off  people because you're not doing well; that's like saving gas by removing  half your engine. Doesn't make sense.\n3. If  an employer wants to pull some vague BS like \"employee wasn't working  out\" or \"employee wasn't growing into the role,\" document it and prove  it. You can't just hide behind a vague phrase like that, it's cowardly  and unprofessional.\n\nAll  terminations will be reviewed by the same respective office that handles unemployment (usually the state's respective Department of Labor or equivalent). During the state's termination review, the employee should be paid full wages in Unemployment. If the state rejects the company's  termination (i.e. doesn't think there's sufficient reason\/evidence), the employee is reinstated. If not, the termination stands, and the  employee is paid full-wage unemployment, but decreases by 2% each week  until it's run out.\n\nExample: Employee is paid $1,000 a week\n\nWeek 1 of unemployment: $1,000\n\nWeek 2 \" \": $980\n\nWeek 3 \" \": $960\n\netc until he finds a job.","84":"I do not understand the hype.

The argument that we all consent to what our government does because the majority voted for it is the same argument that gang rape is consensual because 9 out of 10 participants approved of it. Individual rights shouldn't be subject to a vote. The Nazi's rose to power through the democratic process, and Jim Crow was established under democracy. What is popular isn't necessarily what is right. Another problem with democracy has to do with IQ. Many people aren't capable of making informed political choices and they can be easily swayed by politicians. The US isn't even supposed to be a democracy, and democracy wasn't mentioned in the constitution. A republic with strong protections for individual rights is preferable and is what the founders intended.","86":"I'm really sick of this word. Used to be, you heard it, you knew someone was pissed off, or their opinion about something was really strong, but now it just makes a person sound like they can't think of anything else to say.\n\nIt's such a filler word, with no oomph anymore.\n\nDoesn't anyone else want to go back to a day when hearing it meant something? Like \"oh man Dad is really mad, he said ...... *Whispers* fuck .... Don't tell mom or dad I repeated that\" \n\nNow every 10 year old says it and they sound like a little weiner kid that doesn't even have his first ball hair yet, and they are most obnoxious little pricks on the internet. \n\nIt used to mean something. Now it just makes you sound like a fool.","87":"In fact, due to the human need to know more (beyond ourselves), all humans are religious. When I say religious, I mean \u201cman\u2019s interpretation of the world around them.\u201d\n\nThose who fanaticize science as a belief are just as overbearing, unscientific, and annoying as religious zealots. \n\nPretty much all science is fallible. Scientific \u201cfacts\u201d of 50 years ago, or even 5 years ago, change constantly. Things we believe to be facts today are not facts tomorrow.\n\nPutting all of your faith in scientific fact is, in my opinion, just as \u201cbaseless\u201d as putting your faith in a Creator, and for this reason - you have to be just as \u201creligious\u201d to be an atheist as you have to be \u201creligious\u201d to believe in a God.\n\nYour own religion is what you make of the world around you essentially - and how it came to be. You have to put *faith* in an idea, an opinion on how things came to be.  \n\nTo put it simply, staunch atheists are just as religious as staunch Christians, Muslims, etc.\n\nEvidence is based on what? Another man\u2019s opinion or perspective. You must literally put faith in other men\u2019s observations.\n\nEven then, humans are faulty. We constantly make mistakes. Many things that were believed by everybody about science in the 40\u2019s have been found to be completely untrue. Just because it was \u201cscience\u201d back then, doesn\u2019t mean it is true. Imagine how many things we take as scientific fact today, that will be found to be false in the future. You are putting faith in those ideas.\n\nYou haven\u2019t seen the formation of the Earth for yourself, so you must put faith in an ideology for how it came to be.\n\nI want to be clear about something, I\u2019m not saying that all science is false. I\u2019m just saying that it is verifiably very possible for a little or a lot of it to be faulty or downright false. Your own personal faith in these scientific ideas is what bridges the gap between a given ideology and what you believe.\n\nEdit: I realize after some great conversations below that some of my definitions are cloudy or confusing. There is some really good discourse and clarification below from multiple parties, feel free to read through it and engage with other comments!","88":"You've seen it\n\nThe memes. The preaching. The countless amounts of people saying \"Streaming bad! Companies evil! Piracy is the way!\". The fact that these people are more than happy to teach you to do this shit\n\nI don't hate piracy, I mean I download movies off of Flud (uTorrent mobile is fucking atrocious), but I would be lying if I say that the romanticization and glorification of piracy won't have repercussions\n\nIt's basically vigilante justice all over again. People out here preaching and demanding spite driven death to convicts and the Unspeakable Evil [Groom your hair] but turn around and tell Filipinos that their president killing drug addicts is an inhumane monster, nevermind the fact that both instances are driven by the exact same thing; the thirst for blood and demand for vigilante justice.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the overglorification will also lead to people hopping in and either getting their PCs bricked, or their information phished out of their accounts. My friend pirated Filmora and it took a while for him to realize that it phished out his Instagram account. \n\nSo yeah. How about people Actually mention the dangers of piracy in more detail than \"The seven seas harbors beasts\". Swear to God, potheads and pirates share one thing in common.","89":"I don't care about religion, if you ignore scientific evidence in favor of fiction you're stupid. No matter what your holy book says scientific evidence trumps it.

But I have a different definition of it than most people do. For me, pro-choice isn't strictly about abortion. Abortion is a big part of it, but once you make it safely out of your mother's womb, you're no longer dependent on someone else's body to keep you alive, and therefore it most definitely is \"your body, your choice\", which I am a firm believer in.\n\n\"My body, my choice\" means a lot of things. It means not being forced to undergo any body modifications, like circumcision, piercings, tattoos, etc. (I'm not against those procedures themselves, they just shouldn't be forced upon anyone, especially young children). It also means that children shouldn't be forced to undergo any medical procedures, therapy, etc. without a significant amount of input. They shouldn't be forced to go to therapy for problems they don't actually have, and if they do need to go to therapy, the therapist should listen, ask questions, and take into consideration what the child is saying. The parents would of course still have to sign off on everything, but the therapist should be able to say \"Your child has made it very clear that they do not want to do x, y, and z because it makes them uncomfortable, and I don't think it's in their best interest to force them to do it. You are the parents, but your child is their own person, therefore they should have a say in what happens to them.\"\n\nAnother thing is that pro-choice to me means pro-life, pro-death, and the ability to choose between the two. If a woman chooses to have a baby, that is her choice. But if a person wishes to die for whatever reason, and it can be proven that it's their decision and they haven't been coerced, they should be allowed to do so.\n\nNow, here's the loophole. Many of the people who support the pro-choice movement are also very adamant that people should get vaccinated for COVID. I am vaccinated, so are my parents, and I'm very glad they chose to do so. My family is pretty liberal (I wouldn't say that we're far-left extremists, but we're left-of-center), yet they said that, while they encourage people to get the vaccine, ultimately it is their body and their choice. If they don't want to get the vaccine, they shouldn't be forced to get it. Again, my body, my choice.\n\nTo summarize everything, people who say they believe in \"my body, my choice\" but also support vaccine mandates are hypocrites.","91":"If they had acquired nukes then we would have a North Korea and Pakistan situation. These people are lunatics. Even if they weren't acquiring nukes then, the possibility of it should have been enough.\n\nIs it the best solution though? No, because the middle east is destabilized and rife with civil war - but at least they don't have nukes and aren't a threat to anyone but to themselves.","92":"Having children is rooted in selfish intentions when reproduction rates allow humanity to continue. If a population is in equilibrium, having children is gambling people's lives just so you can have a family. \n\nWith mental health, genetics, and general randomness from life, you could birth a child that lives in hell regardless of how a person is raised or their environment. The outcome of the child is mostly luck. The child could grow up to kill themselves and the parent would be 100% to blame. They had the child just so they could have a family of blood relatives when they could've simply adopted. No one chooses to live and birth is forcing life on someone. \n\nHaving a kid is one of the most selfish and fucked up things one can do. If you had a kid and they happen to be perfectly fine, cool but your lucky you didn't create a person to live in pain. Abort and adopt.","93":"Bro anyone saying America is a car-dependent culture is trippin'\n\n\nCars may still be the dominant form of human transportation in the US, but the infrastructure is actually improving, at least where I live, they're literally building a hiking trail from Austin to San Antonio \n\n\n\n\nHowever, the other forms of infrastructure will never catch up in the US, because the US never had time to actually establish its infrastructure on other behalves of transportation, since the US by the time the industrial revolution hit, had to deal with the pressures from the higher powers that be to pioneer the automobile\n\n\nAnd not only that, are we forgetting that like 50-70% of America is very rural? Even major cities have their fair share of rural parts, how the fuck is having a less car-centered infrastructure going to be efficient for the people living in those areas? \n\n\nAnd if other forms of transportation were dominant, it would make transport of consumer goods even more impractical \n\n\nI do have a bias because I am car enthusiast who unironically doesn't have their license yet, but I am not too trigger happy to start driving because I know it is a huge responsibility, and it still costs a shit ton of money the course anyway\n\n\nBut still get real, is an impractical nothingdream of a wish to want a less car-centered infrastructure in America \n\nPlus cultural significance \n\nEuropeans are more localized and more community-oriented\n\nAmericans are more individualist and more overaching, in American culture, even non-enthusiasts associate cars with individual freedom and personal responsibility and it is a major part of adulting owning and driving a car, even if owning a car is a hassle to some extent, many won't still deny the joys of being in control of your very own car, I don't think the majority of people want to trade off that very individual liberty for more comfort and securtiy \n\nPlus commute times would even more screwed up for the people, if cars were to be outright banned\n\n\nAgain Europe is more localized where as America is just more overaching, the average home to grocery store distance in America is like 3.79 miles, not a whole lot, but are we really going to waste time doing all these walks to grocery stores? Come on get real, the average person would consume 1 hour to 3 just walking to get to the grocery store","94":"Anyone who's played Fallout knows that the game has a 1950s aesthetic, especially later titles like Fallout 4 and 76. Now, there's one thing I do take issue with. It's that the culture and aesthetic, remaining virtually unchanged from 1955 until 2077, is extremely unrealistic. We all know that culture, as well as architecture, can and will change, and rapidly in an industrialized world. Just look at how everything changed from 1860 to 1890, or 1900 to 1930. You mean to tell me, that when it comes to culture, architecture, clothing, and many other things, it remained completely stagnant for over 120 years?\n\nI get that lore wise the transistor and microprocessor weren't invented until way later on down the road, but I offer a counterargument, there were no microprocessors or transistors in the 1800s, yet architecture, culture, and clothing all changed drastically over the course of that century. Just look at how men dressed in the year 1800 and how they dressed in 1899, it's a stark difference. Yet the Fallout universe expects us to believe that people in up until 2077, would build, dress, talk, and have the same culture the exact same way it was in 1955? I honestly think that it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.","95":"Many here seem to think that women mog the shit out of men since women have a way higher sexual market value than men. But the truth is the exact opposite for the exact same reason. Since women are picky about who they want to have sex with, there is far more selection pressure on men to look attractive vs women.\n\nPeople will usually object to what I've said by saying, but women look prettier or \"only chad mogs women but most women mog the average man.\" You think women look prettier because you are a straight man not because women are actually more aesthetic. And the average man does mog the fuck out of an average woman since for his genes to even exist, the men in his genealogy had to be chads while the women only had to have a pulse.\n\nPlus look at other animals. Even ugly male peacocks mogs a female peacocks because of how colourful and elegant a male peacock is... We see the same thing in mammals. Male lions that look subhuman compared to other males still mog female lions because of their elegant manes and more muscular bodies.\n\nEven in humans, men are taller, broader, and more muscular. Our faces are more angular, our eyes are more piercing because they're deeper set. Our jaws are more chiseled and defined. We're also the more hairy sex which is actually a halo. If you want an unbiased opinion compare animals with hair compared to hairless animals. Hairy animals mog the hell out of hairless animals.","96":"People on Reddit definitely love taking the moral high ground. Nothing new, but when you pay attention, it really is the ultimate deflect strategy to avoid answering questions. \n\nNearly every time a Redditor presents some faulty logic or says something crazy and receives a logical question or concern in response, even in good faith, the ultimate default is always \u201cyou\u2019re just not empathetic I guess.\u201d \u201cYou just hate _____ I guess.\u201d \u201cYou just don\u2019t care if _______ I guess.\u201d\n\nYes, extreme examples exist and I get that, don\u2019t give me the lecture. But when I see a Redditor take the moral high ground, or anyone for that matter, I typically find that they have no rebuttal to an actual intellectual conversation and do so to try to salvage any self-image in the midst of their loss.","97":"Many people don't realise that saying 'blood is thicker than the water' doesn't actually mean that family relationships are strongest and most important ones.\n\nThe original saying is: 'The blood of the convenant is thicker than the water of the womb' which obviously has the opposite meaning which I agree with - bonds made by choice are often more important and stronger than family ties.\n\nI could never understand how one could choose a family member over a best friend or loved one simply because they're relatives.\n\nEdit - there were some doubts around what I'm referring to so I'll give some examples:\n\nI would rather help out my best friend in a difficult situation than e.g. a sister I speak to once a month and have a decent relationship with (providing they would both need my help at the same time).\n\nI would also rather help out an acquaintance, not even someone I know very well, who actually needs money\/goods, rather than giving them away to my mother who's alright financially.\n\nI brought this topic because of a specific situation - I don't live in my home country and I mentioned via phone conversation that I'll take some Ukrainian family\/refugees home once I move houses. My family told me off because 'what if they will need my help' if war starts in our country. I replied - 'Then we'll all have to manage living in one place for a while.' I guess I mean there would be no difference for me with providing shelter to relatives or strangers, that's just humanity.\n\nEdit 2: My opinion excludes parents, as they have a responsibility to provide what's the best for their children since they brought them to this world.","98":"[removed]","99":"There is no problem preferring someone for what genitals they have. People have a million different reasons in preferring their sexual\/marriage partners, and the genitals a person has is just as legitimate reason as any other in making partner choices. Such legitimate reasons for choosing partners based off of genitals are such things that people might want to have biological children, they might be only attracted to certain types of genitals, personal trauma might repel them from other types, and so on. No one should ever be shamed or condemned because of their genital preferences for sexual partners or ANY other type of criteria they have for choosing their sexual partners. And anyone who DOES try to shame others for such sexual boundaries, and tries to actively break down those sexual boundaries with shaming, is tantamount to a sexual predator.","100":"[deleted]","101":"According to [brittanica.com](https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/list\/9-of-the-worlds-deadliest-spiders#:~:text=More%20than%2043%2C000%20different%20species,been%20responsible%20for%20human%20deaths.) 99.95% of ALL 43,000 spiders species have been Identified as non lethal to humans.

In spite of 'retard' being a term used for the mentally disabled, the same people that cry over 'faggot' will suddenly rush to defend the use of the word 'retard'.\n\nAll of a sudden, all that nuance they place on the word 'fag\/faggot\/gay' immediately disappears the moment you're using a term to refer to the disabled. So now you're telling me that this sick and twisted term can perfectly apply to any given context without dehumanizing the disabled? All of a sudden retard doesn't inherently mean 'you're dumb because you're disabled, and being disabled is wrong'? Are you kidding me?\n\nHere's the real truth, both words are inherently wrong, but because gay people have a voice, look like us, talk like us, work like us,etc. YOU became inclined to brush off every single insult that could be related to them.  \nBut disabled people don't have a voice, they can't do many of the things 'normal' people do.

You;re basically looking at your data page by page, hitting the down button or scroll bar and then waiting and waiting for it to load like poor some kid in the early 90s with a 2400 baud modem\n\nIf these pages weren't annoying enough, they have also turned the End key into the most useless key on the keyboard - it is effectively now just another PgDn, which was a pathetic key anyway since you can just use the down arrow or scroll bar to do the same thing.  PgDn is so irrelevant that they never even put it on the same place in a laptop keyboard, but End is now even less useful.\n\nWhat I am proposing is simple - the End key should do what it says on the label, which is take you to the end of the web page. So for infinitely scrolling web pages, which have no end, they should just continue to load data until there is nothing left to load, or until you've exhausted every scrap of RAM and hard drive space your system can find, compressing all of your old data if necessary, or maybe just deleting it if you have a recent backup.\n\nI understand that people may complain when there is no way to abort this procedure so I would also propose a pop-up confirmation that comes up the first time you use the End key on an infinitely scrolling web page that says something like:\n\n###You have just pressed the End key which is the most powerful key on the keyboard.  This is your one and only warning.  We are not fucking around here.  \n\nThen we would show a clip of Will Smith smacking Chris Rock at the Oscars just to show that shit is, indeed, real.\n\nAnd then, from that point on, the End key will operate the way that it was always designed to, which means that on an infinitely scrolling web page, your computer will load all of the data available or die trying, and will rightfully respond with angry beeps if you hit Esc or try to close the browser window, just to make it .clear how much power the End key now wields.","109":"First of, I believe we evolved as ovnivores, we should get our nutrition from all sources to be healthy, a plant only diet can be done but you must be very disciplined, monitor your diet really closely (and in some cases take supplements) or you risk being malnourished or have other health problems.\n\nNow, every now and then when I see a discussion about food there's that guy with their moral high ground claiming we don't need to eat animals, and because of that is immoral to inflict distress and suffering to said animals, destroy ecosystems to make grounds for raising them for human consumption, and generally harming the environment more than we need to.\n\nAnd there is some validity to these claims, however if they are really that worried about animals and the planet, and want to live a life style that is less harmful and sustainable, they should start eating insects as a core part of their diets.\n\nInsects are insanely easy to breed, they have a really high protein content per gram, they need less space and resources, they are all around the best choice as a sustainable food source.\n\nAnd if you my friend are concerned about insect suffering, you're far too gone, are you concerned about that mosquito you just smacked?, Or that cockroach you stomped with your foot?.\n\nThe only reason reason people don't like it is because cultural conditioning, where I'm from people eat some species of grasshoppers and ants, cocked or grounded as ingredients for other dishes and it's normal.\n\nSo hey you vegan!, Start eating insects and save the planet!","110":"If you use anonymity software. i.e. tor (software used to enter the deep\/dark web) and Tails OS (a portable operating system that protects against surveillance and censorship) all the times thats mean you have something wrong\/illegal to hide \nBut in the same time if you post your life online with all the details (i.e. address, face, phone number, frequent place you go to like some cafe) this is worse because not only government can get you easily but also thieves, gold diggers, hate criminals have some useful and accurate informations to locate AND THIS INFORMATION IS UNDELETABLE they may restore it by some web crawlers (google hidden pages) and individual data holders r\/DataHoarder.","111":"The marketplace of ideas is the notion that the good ideas will dominate in a sea of competing ideas. It sounds good in theory, but this makes the flawed assumption that the majority of humans act rationally and in good faith, when this is not true. People have biases and emotions that cause them to ignore reason. Furthermore, many topics are inherently complicated; people may not always be willing to listen to the nuances of a topic or they may not even be capable of understanding them.  Because of this, it's not necessarily true that the best ideas will dominate in a marketplace of ideas.\n\nFor a platform to successfully implement a marketplace of ideas, its users have to be capable of rational thought and willing to prioritize rational thought when contributing to the marketplace. The former of these two is relatively easy to implement. By making some sort of intellectual puzzle or test a requirement to creating an account, you can weed out people who are incapable of higher-order thought. These tests should also present themselves randomly from time to time while someone is using the platform in order to mitigate cheaters who have someone else help them make an account. If the test is not completed in time or the person performs poorly, their account should be locked for some time. Repeated failures to complete these tests should result in a ban, with the opportunity for an appeal. This is not a perfect solution, but I think it will really minimize the number and impact of irrational individuals on a platform, ensuring that the majority of users are people capable of reason and logic.\n\nThe other problem, that the majority of users must be willing to prioritize reason is much harder to solve. Intelligent people often resort to irrational arguments out of their desire to promote an agenda. If the majority of users on a platform are like this, you're not really going to have a marketplace of ideas. It may sound unlikely that the majority of people on a platform are just going to be agenda pushers, but I'd argue that this isn't the case at all. The people who are most vested in a platform to share ideas are the people who want to push agendas. They will be the ones most likely to participate in this sort of thing as well as the ones who will spend the most time participating. People without an agenda are probably not going to participate as much. The only potential solution that I can think of is some level of content moderation, but this runs the risk of leading to censorship, which ruins the whole idea of a free marketplace. If anyone can think of other potential solutions to this problem, please mention it.\n\nEven if we don't have a solution to the second problem, I think any platform that solves the first problem will be much closer to achieving a marketplace of ideas than any other platform that exists. Weed out the people who can't understand reason and you'll have one less problem to worry about.","112":"[removed]","113":" Basically what the title says, so pretty self explanatory.

They often point to things like affirmative actions and use this as a basis for making the argument that white people are less privileged.\n\nHowever, this ignores the fact that such programs are only put in place to compensate for a disadvantage that already exists. For example, if someone has bad eyesight and they therefore get glasses, this isn't discriminatory against those with good eyesight. The same principles applies to affirmative action.\n\nWhite people experience life from a privileged perspective, but they often fail to realize this, because the privilege is invisible to those who experience it - the privilege they receive is not being held back or discriminated against for their race in any way. Since this privilege is the absence of something rather than the presence of something, it could not be perceived without knowing what was absent. But since white people do not experience life from the perspective of a Black person, they do not realize the extent to which they face discrimination, and therefore, as white people, do not appreciate the fact of not experiencing said discrimination.","119":"I recently read an [article](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) that proves that it is really easy to cure cancer and th eonly reason it's not being distributed is because it will kill the profits of Big Pharma.

New technology might *lessen some* effects, but it would likely *increase other* negative effects on society (that may or may not be climate-related). Being more environmentally conscious would delay it, but it's only a matter of time before that doesn't work. And even if individuals are more environmentally conscious, big companies, which do just as much damage if not more, will never be held accountable because people in power are greedy.\n\nPlus, you can't get all of society to do one thing, it's futile. The pandemic has proved this. People are far more divided now than they ever have been. People won't wear a face covering to keep themselves or others from dying, either because they don't understand or they don't care. Getting everyone to use clean energy, take public transport, etc. won't work, especially since some people live in areas where these options are unaffordable or near impossible to achieve.\n\nIf anything, we should be preparing FOR climate change rather than whining about how we can't stop it. We might be able to create facilities that can withstand extreme heat\/water and stay cool and dry inside. With our new medical knowledge and technology, we might be able to develop vaccines\/antibiotics for the ancient deadly diseases that could plague us. Stuff like that. But even that stuff would probably become futile after a while.\n\nIt is likely that climate change is a natural event that has been greatly increased by human activity, meaning it would eventually be inevitable no matter how hard we try. I DO NOT DENY THE YEARS OF SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT PROVE THE EARTH'S TEMPERATURE BEGAN RISING MUCH MORE QUICKLY AT THE START OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. I am offering up the possibility that while human activity has GREATLY SPED UP the Earth's temperature, that the rising may be something that would naturally happen eventually, just not for thousands\/millions\/billions? more years. Why do I think this? Probably because the existence of an Ice Age indicates the existence of another extreme, a \"heat age.\" Anyways, humans are very intelligent, but we are not entirely above nature and natural processes. Eventually, humanity will run its course somehow. We can try to delay it, but it is inevitable. And I have a feeling the Earth will recover okay if\/when humanity is wiped off it. As George Carlin says, \"The planet is fine. The PEOPLE are fucked.\"\n\nWe have this superficial desire to build up society as much as possible, while avoiding the fact that these advancements will most likely lead to our demise. The pattern is seen again and again throughout history, yet we cannot learn from it. But then again, what else are we to do? We are only human. Inventing technology, advancing society, etc. seems to sort of be what humans do. You would think that our ability to be aware of the effects of our behaviors would lead us to do something about it, but a lot of us are so caught up in our own lives that we don't bother. In a way, that makes us sort of animalistic. We are still animals, still a part of nature. The evidence of this is stronger now than it ever has been.\n\nIn the end, the net negative is that humans will no longer exist. In the greater scheme of things, this changes almost nothing. Perhaps there will be missed opportunity, but again, that is looking at it from a human's perspective, not a universal perspective.\n\nFrom a universal perspective, we are pretty small and insignificant.\n\nShit, that was a trip.

But, in this case, the destruction isn't so complete or total that someone in a non-democratic society would be able to even achieve the destruction of their enemies.\n\nSo, say we have the capacity to \"win\" a nuclear war, but the cost would still be enormous.

It is only then that people will begin to react and declare that something needs to be done. As long as the victims of these murders are overwhelmingly minorities, the bodies that direct mainstream media discussion will largely ignore this topic because, 1.) they don't care about urban murder within minority communities and 2.) they are afraid that covering it at all will make them look racist.

[Lyrics](https:\/\/www.songfacts.com\/lyrics\/glenn-frey\/smugglers-blues).  [Video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LSXKyHM133c).  It is forever associated with the TV series Miami Vice as the writer (Micheal Mann) heard the song on the radio during the first season and put both the song and singer in the show.\n\n    The sailors and pilots, the soldiers and the law,\n    The pay offs and the rip offs, and the things nobody saw. \n    No matter if it's heroin,  cocaine, or hash,\n    You've got to carry weapons, cause you always carry cash. \n\nHow are drug crimes actually prosecuted?  As Radley Balko, of Reason magazine writes in his 2010 article [How Drug Cops Go Bad](https:\/\/reason.com\/2011\/03\/21\/how-drug-cops-go-bad), virtually all criminal prosecutions are based upon police informants (who get reduced sentences), or the police themselves setting up the drug deal, potentially manufacturing crime.  (In fact, police prefer to sell drugs rather than buy them, so that they can keep the cash and then sell the same drugs again.)\n\n    There's lots of shady characters,  Lots of dirty deals.\n    Every name's an alias, In case somebody squeals.\n    It's the lure of easy money, It's gotta very strong appeal. \n\nFor this morally dubious behavior, they are rewarded with forfeiture proceeds.  There are many police officers and former police officers who are against the drug war, partly because they have seen its corrupting influence on law enforcement.  But not every drug dealer is willing to get ripped off by police or each other, which is why drug-related homicides account for somewhere between 1\/3 to 1\/2 of all homicides.  Drug users also account for a significant fraction (15-25%) of burglaries.  (Note that different studies define drug-related crime in [different ways](https:\/\/www.ojp.gov\/pdffiles1\/nij\/grants\/246404.pdf)).\n\n    See it in the headlines, you hear it every day.\n    They say they're gonna stop it, but it doesn't go away. \n\n\nCNBC, 2021:  [America has spent over a trillion dollars fighting the war on drugs. 50 years later, drug use in the U.S. is climbing again.](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/06\/17\/the-us-has-spent-over-a-trillion-dollars-fighting-war-on-drugs.html)\n\n> \u201c__We are still in the midst of the most devastating drug epidemic in U.S. history,__\u201d according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, senior fellow at the Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology at Brookings Institution.\n\nWhile lots of people say they are against the drug war, it means absolutely nothing if you vote for the same people who continue it every year.  People who actually put their reputations on the line to help non-violent offenders, like Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, are few and far between, and Trump never received any credit for his First Step Act that freed thousands of non-violent offenders, including [Alice Marie Johnson](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alice_Marie_Johnson).  Ron Paul supporters know the feeling.\n\nThe sad fact is that nobody really cares about drug addicts or drug prisoners - they've been forgotten by both liberals (who abandon old causes just as quickly as they jump onto new ones, and whose issues are now vetted by their corporate backers) and by old-school conservatives (who like certain kinds of big government and authoritarianism and happily ignore that there is no constitutional argument for Federal Drug enforcement).\n\n    It's propping up the governments in Columbia and Peru,\n    You ask any D.E.A. man, He'll say \"There's nothin' we can do\",\n    From the office of the President, Right down to me and you,\n\n\nThe drug war was started by Richard Nixon, but escalated significantly in the 1980s due to the efforts of Senator [Joe Biden](https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2019\/09\/17\/the-untold-story-joe-biden-pushed-ronald-reagan-to-ramp-up-incarceration-not-the-other-way-around\/) who argued that the nation's drug enforcement budget should be equivalent to the nation's military budget.   \n\n> It was Biden who was among the principal and earliest movers of the policy agenda that would become the war on drugs and mass incarceration, and he did so in the face of initial reluctance from none other than President Ronald Reagan. \n\nBiden has never paid a political price for this and it looks like he never will, making his way from Senator to Vice-President to President, as Democrats gave him a pass (he did after all bring in a ton of financial industry money) and moved on to other issues.  The message to politicians is clear - if you want to win elections and advance in politics, just turn poor addicts into criminals.  Of course Biden's own son, Hunter, was addicted to crack and even took photos of himself smoking it, and yet has never served a single day in jail.  Rich kids get treatment and poor kids get locked up.\n\n    It's a losing proposition, But one you can't refuse.\n    It's the politics of contraband, It's the smuggler's blues, \n\nAt this point, even though it's a failed policy, it looks like the odds of ending the drug war are basically zero - there are simply too many people making too much money from it and too many politicians whose careers are invested in it.  And Glen Frey called it back in 1984, and his song has been relevant for 38 years and is still relevant today.","149":"[deleted]","150":"If you're male and having sex with men you have a MUCH higher chance of getting and spreading AIDS.

Those evil leftists must be sneaking CRT on the math curriculum. You might be wondering about the details of this prohibited material, are they teaching that white people are inherently and fundamentally evil?

In another, a cartoon dog movie star says she feels lonely, and other animals offer to befriend her. \n\nCASEL defended the idea of including social and emotional concepts in math lessons. \u201cResearch confirms that social and emotional learning bolsters academic achievement because it helps students focus on learning and engage more deeply with content,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIf our nation prioritizes the academic growth of young people, we must also prioritize their social-emotional learning.\u201d \n\nAttempting to stimulate a child's imagination in order to help them engage with otherwise dry arithmetic? We simply can't have that. Helping an old lady cross a bridge is far too woke, perhaps Ron DeSantis believes we should be pushing them in front of busses. \n\nThis anti-woke crusade is nothing more than a political witch hunt and the GOP are using children as pawns.","152":"[deleted]","153":"The bottom line is that JK Rowling profits from all of these things.

Fittingly, it is produced in the balls, and it's what's responsible for male characteristic traits, both physical and behaviorial. Testosterone is what makes men engage in metaphorical dick waving contests.

No less harmful to be sure, the drive to \"win\" and \"conquer\" in day to day life is what makes men engage in zero sum ventures like daring games at its least pernicious, and profit seeking schemes at its most, where in either case the goal is to gain as much \"capital\" as possible at the expense of everyone and everything else, even if it causes fractures and divisions among each other, stratification of society, and irreparable destruction to the environment and climate. \n\nWhen it comes to attempted reproduction, testosterone is what makes men act irrationally to impress women in often dangerous and stupid ways, often compromising their own or the woman's safety to prove something. Testosterone is what makes a man might think it's a good idea to drive 120mph on a residential road in a Mustang until crashing into an innocent car or home, hurting and killing others for no reason.\n\nMy central point is this: Testosterone kills. It has killed more people than any other chemical in world history.

When people die demand drops equally as supply drops. For example, when New York gets hit, you may not get any more apples from there, but there's millions of people less who want apples. Some cities, like Detroit, would be an economical gain if it was nuked. \n\nPeople also have weird misconceptions about radiation. They think an area that has been nuked will just be radioactive forever. That's not how it works, the area is only radioactive for a few days then go back to normal. The reason why Chernobyl is still radioactive is that it's an ongoing nuclear reaction.","175":"The big news these days is about how Russia isn't good at fighting the war in the Ukraine.

If you look at when other countries fought, like the Iran-Iraq war, or how the Syrian government fought their civil war, it's chaotic and goes poorly at times. \n\nIf for example China had to fight a massive war against India, it would probably look similar to what is happening in the Ukraine now, and the western media would probably ask \"why were we afraid of China when they are so bad at fighting?\". \n\nHell, if the US ever got their own country invade, they would fight equally bad. Imagine if South America united under some ideology or ruler, then invaded through Mexico. As soon as US cities were under siege and airports were being denied by artillery, you could have similar tactical mistakes.

This isn\u2019t a guarantee that the incel can eventually get with their \u201cdream\u201d girl, but doing these at least increases the chances of it. And if they don\u2019t end up with them, hey, they\u2019re in a better position to find a partner even if whoever it is isn\u2019t their \u201cfirst choice\u201d. Alternatively, if self-betterment sounds like too much work and sex is the only goal, just pay for it. No shame in that.\n\nSex has never been a fundamental human right. Incels aren\u2019t even being denied sex, they\u2019re being denied access to sex with women they find sexually attractive. While I can sympathize that it sucks that they can\u2019t get with these girls, believe me when I say there are probably thousands more they could realistically get with. They should stop thinking just in terms of the women in their town\/state, try thinking globally! \n\nNow, people who hate landlords:  \n \n\n1.) View home-ownership as a fundamental human right (it isn\u2019t!), and that to be denied it is like denying them a basic human necessity.\n\n2.) Have a hatred of landlords because they see them as the people who get all the houses, leaving none for them to purchase\n\n3.) Wish harm upon landlords, the \u201cgatekeepers of housing\u201d and congregate in various forums\/communities to speak ill of them and describe all the disgusting heinous shit they want to happen to them (seriously, check out some of the anti-landlord subreddits, they call all landlords names like pigs\/leeches, and venerate people like Mao Zedong by saying shit like \u201cMao was right\u201d. Yes, that same Mao that lead the slaughter of landlords in China. Also the same Mao who would ironically become China\u2019s biggest landlord, but we don\u2019t talk about that)\n\n4.) Could have housing if they just lowered their standards, worked on their finances, or just rented. For example, maybe they should stop trying to buy in an HCOL area. They could move to a cheaper state or even country. Or, if they\u2019re really deadset on a certain housing market, they could work harder, try to make a business, or pivot into an industry that pays more. This is not a guarantee that that dreamhouse will eventually become affordable, but if they don\u2019t end up with that house, hey, at least they\u2019re in a better position to find a nice house even if whereever\/whatever it is isn\u2019t your \u201cfirst choice\u201d. Or just rent! There\u2019s nothing wrong with renting forever. \n\nHome-ownership has never been a fundamental human right. Access to shelter is, and in most cases they are not being denied this. They\u2019re being denied access to shelter\/housing in \u201cnice\u201d communities\/neighborhoods, but nobody is entitled to live in a specific place. It sucks that they can\u2019t participate in their preferred housing market, but believe me when I say there are probably thousands more in their price range. Don\u2019t just think in terms of your state\/country, think globally! \n\nThanks for coming to my tedtalk","192":"So called \"atheists\" are just assholes.  They're not smart.  They're not clever.

Not the part that women are evil are something, but the part that getting a girlfriend is an exercise in futility.\n\nI've been trying to get a girlfriend for 7 months straight now, and I haven't even gotten close to getting one. I've joined dating apps a month and a half ago, and I have gotten nothing. It's becoming very obvious that women only want the same thing. A rich tall man who exudes pure confidence and can make everyone in the room laugh effortlessly.\n\nThat is the complete opposite of who I am. I'm just a broke college student who is very quiet and barely know my way around a joke. I'm 5'7 which is below average. Also it should be noted that my personality isn't a confidence thing, It's just who I am. It's how I am with my family, how i am with my best friend, and how I am alone. \n\nWhy have I been setup for failure? I tried to deny it,  but it's becoming increasingly obvious, the incels are right. Women have set ridiculous standards and there is no way I can hope to reach them. The only time a girl has called me cute, is right before she ask me for money.\n\nThere is nothing else for me to do than to cry myself to sleep every night.","206":"There are many politicians whom I strongly disagree with on both sides of the political aisle.

They are reprehensible. It is not socially acceptable, however, to call AOC the embarrassment to the American people that she truly is.  \n\nEvery time I hear AOC speak, I lose brain cells. I feel like I am listening to a high schooler presenting a report full of idealistic proposals which are easily abandoned with a little bit of life experience. The Green New Deal is a colossal failure because it is impractical to assume that fossil fuels can be entirely replaced by renewable energy with no focus on nuclear. Guess what, Alexandria.. the sun isn't always shining, the wind is not always blowing, eventually there is no space to build dams on the rivers.   \n\nIt is absolutely hypocritical to claim that you are for \"taxing the rich\" while wearing a dress designed by someone who is known for tax evasion. It is hypocritical to claim the Right is trying to dictate who is and is not a woman when you cannot even define the word woman without using \"woman\" in the definition.   It is also hypocritical to claim to be against capitalism while you sell socialist-themed merchandise in your online store. Woke capitalism for the win!\n\nThen there's the sheer, blatant narcissism. Anyone who criticizes the content of her views is accused of having a sexual or romantic infatuation with her, or is accused of \"cat-calling\" or being sexist\/racist\/etc. She has no ability to recognize that just maybe she is not always right. No, your criticism of her cannot possibly be because her ideas warrant being challenged... nope, you MUST be racist, sexist, or sexually obsessed. This way of thinking is a horrible one for any person, but to have a member of US Congress stating these things in the media for not only other Americans but the entire world to read is just embarrassing. She is so absorbed into the celebrity cult of personality of her role, not realizing her job is to serve the people of the US rather than act like life is a reality show.  \n\nI cannot wait for the day that her narcissism and hubris get the better of her and she runs for the House of Representatives or for the Presidency, and receives a swift wake-up call that outside of her district, most Americans do not believe that renewable energy can supplement fossil fuels entirely, that the Senate should be abolished, that Israel is the embodiment of evil but we should be silent on Turkey\/Russia\/Saudi Arabia\/etc., that there are an unlimited number of genders, that any criticism of a person of color constitutes racism or sexual obsession, or that the Federal Government is qualified to administer healthcare.  \n\n MABA.

It teaches children to disrespect their parents and to embrace hedonism. The movie is entirely about embracing your \"wild side\" (quote from the film) and doesn't even touch the idea of consequences or the idea that parents know what's best. For a 15-year-old, this is a great message, but for kids, it's problematic, because 5-year-olds shouldn't be thinking about rebelling. Children of that age simply don't know what's best.\n\nI also think the plot was really disappointing. The dad's conversation with Mei Mei had great potential to shake up the plot, but it ended up being a dead-end. It would have been much better if the big argument the mom had with her mom to be about Mei Mei's mom originally wanting to keep her panda like Mei Mei, because this would add more depth and would provide balance between healthy rebellion and parents knowing what is best. It also would have been better if it was revealed that, if Mei Mei kept her panda, the whole family kept their pandas, thus proving that the parents had good reason for not letting her keep her pandas, but instead it was a shallow film about \"Asian parents bad\".

Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGive up stock options for nothing\u201d was possibly Elon believing that UAW is generally against stock options in compensation packages.\n\nThis first possibility is backed up by Elon in a Twitter reply two days later:\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/999415738967277568](https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/999415738967277568)\n\nTwitter user- \u201cYou took that out of context, he clarified that in a response where he believed that UAW does not allow union workers to own stock.\u201d\n\nElon- \u201cExactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.\u201d\n\nAnd by a later Tesla statement:\n\n\u201cElon\u2019s tweet was simply a recognition of the fact that unlike Tesla, we\u2019re not aware of a single UAW-represented automaker that provides stock options or restricted stock units to their production employees, and UAW organizers have consistently dismissed the value of Tesla equity as part of our compensation package,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cWe fundamentally believe it\u2019s critical that all employees be owners of Tesla so that everyone is on the same team, with all sharing in the company\u2019s success.\u201d\n\n[https:\/\/uaw.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/2018-UAW-Constitution.pdf](https:\/\/uaw.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/2018-UAW-Constitution.pdf)\n\nIt is also entirely possible that this was a veiled threat, and a judge ruled it was in the proceeding court case. However, the court proceeding provided doesn\u2019t offer an investigation into possible alternative interpretations of the tweet aside from a threat. It seems weird, however, maybe it was omitted from the document? I can\u2019t find any convincing arguments within the preceding that prove it was a threat, however, this still remains a possibility.\n\n**Elon musk is a union buster:**\n\nMost of this circles around this court case:\n\n[https:\/\/www.courthousenews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tesla-nlrb.pdf](https:\/\/www.courthousenews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/tesla-nlrb.pdf)\n\nThe take away\u2019s are:\n\nElon musk had a meeting with two employees seeking a union. In the meeting, he expressed that unionizing would give the union itself a voice, not tesla employees, and invited them to attend a weekly safety committee to express their concerns. Elon then said, if the committee doesn\u2019t work out, \u201cwe\u2019ll give you your union\u201d;\n\nFive employees were passing out union leaflets in the facility's parking lot. Working independently of musk, multiple different security guards repeatedly asked them for their employee badges and to leave the premises. One guard expressed an anti-union settlement, and the employees finally left after an employee falsy claiming to be from hr talked with them directly. These actions are considered illegal, as the security guards were considered to have \u201cactual or apparent authority to act on behalf of the party.\u201d\n\nMy interpretation:\n\nThere is no proof or reason to believe they were acting directly under the authority of musk, however, this reflects poorly on tesla as a company. Throughout the document, it seems tesla, from the managers to workers generally have hostile anti-union stances independent of musk himself and acted autonomously to intervene in a small but legal rally. Musk is seemly not guilty of suppressing unions, but instead, negligence in properly educating his employees about the rights of fellow employees\/ properly enforcing said rights.\n\nNext, two members of the protest were later found to have taken information on pro-union employee\u2019s salary from an app used at the plant and published it on a private Facebook page.\n\nInciting report:\n\n\u201cDuring this conversation, Pratt told Gecewich that he sent the Facebook post to Hedges and had received the information from employee Bryan Kostich (Kostich) (Tr. 1086). Pratt told Gecewich that the Facebook post was from a Facebook page called, \u201cFair Future at Tesla\u201d (Tr. 1086). Gecewich testified that Pratt told him that he thought the information in the Facebook post was inappropriate as it included how much money employees made at Respondent, and Pratt thought that he was being singled out (Tr. 1807\u20131808). Pratt complained that he felt uncomfortable with Ortiz speculating how much he made as well as the posting of his name and picture (Tr. 1807\u20131808).\u201d\n\nOrtiz\u2019s Interrogation:\n\nGecewich started the meeting by asking about the Workday profile screenshots on the Facebook post. Gecewich and Ortiz then had a conversation about where the screenshots came from. Ortiz eventually admitted that it must have been Moran who sent the screenshots to him via text message but that he had received these screenshots from others as well (Tr. 530, 1842). Apparently prior to his meeting with Gecewich, Moran spoke to Ortiz about his meeting with Gecewich. During this meeting with Gecewich, Ortiz expressed concern about being fired and was worried in the prior meeting that he would be fired. Ortiz also spoke about his nature not to bring others into his own problems, and that he was protecting other employees including Moran (Tr. 1842\u20131844). By the end of this meeting, Ortiz had told Gecewich from where the photos had come.\n\nThe stated reason for termination:\n\nAfter these meetings with Ortiz and Moran, Gecewich drafted a report of his investigation with recommended actions (Tr. 1846, 1850). Gecewich testified that he based his recommendations on looking at similar cases as well as the \u201cunique facts of this case\u201d (Tr. 1851). Gecewich testified that he considered Workday profile photos and any Workday screenshots to be sensitive; Gecewich\u2019s characterization of the Workday photos or screenshots is based on his own belief that Workday is an internal data system (Tr. 1935). During his investigation, Gecewich claimed he never sought to learn what happened in Sacramento, went to the Facebook page to look at the page and never found out who were the members of the Facebook group (Tr. 1823, 1835). After drafting the report, Gecewich showed it to Tesla\u2019s in-house counsel (Tr. 1849). Gecewich\u2019s recommendation for termination of Ortiz and warning for Moran were \u201caligned with legal\u201d (Tr. 1930). But a prior version of his report shows that Gecewich along with in-house counsel edited the investigatory report which was originally created on October 12 (GC Exh. 85). In a prior version of this report, Gecewich wrote, \u201cThis time frame corresponds to when these three Tesla employees went to Sacramento, California to speak with State legislatures about on behalf of Tesla\u201d (Tr. 2201)\n\nOrtiz\u2019s termination:\n\nMcIntosh testified that Gecewich began the meeting by informing Ortiz that the investigation he had conducted was closed (Tr. 2066). According to McIntosh, Gecewich told Ortiz that he was found to be dishonest during the process as he was not forthcoming about some images or where the images came from and recommended termination.\n\nMy personal interpretation of events:\n\nA tesla manager fired an employee unlawfully and tesla's legal council okayed the termination based on what said manager provided them. Again reflects poorly on tesla, however, there is no concrete evidence that Elon musk was directly involved in said firing or that the firing was covertly because of Ortiz\u2019s attempts at unionizing. Any claims of union-busting fall into the realm of speculation, and if so are likely solely Cecewich\u2019s personal motives. My speculation is that Elon Musk was not directly involved in Ortiz\u2019s firing, and especially not on the basis of Ortiz\u2019s pro-union stances. Ortiz and his five supporters are a vast minority of the plant's 10,000 and likely wouldn\u2019t have gained traction in such an anti-union work culture. I personally do not see any reason Elon musk would go out of his way to have Ortiz fired other than pure spite, which is possible but unlikely.\n\n**Elon musk p guy tweet:**\n\n[**https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/2j6kr9hu**](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/2j6kr9hu)\n\nSeams like it was a mildly derogatory slang term in South Africa possibly particularly prevalent where he grew up. The article title is written to make it seem less prevalent than the comments from south Africans imply, however overall I believe it was still an inappropriate lash out that he deserves to be criticized for.\n\n**Tesla uses cobalt sourced from mines that utilize child labor:**\n\n[https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/mobile.reuters.com\/article\/amp\/idUSKBN23U20Q](https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/mobile.reuters.com\/article\/amp\/idUSKBN23U20Q)\n\nThe vast majority of the world's cobalt comes from the congo where child slavery is frequently used. Tesla has taken a step forward to ensure its batteries are more socially responsible and a step back. Firstly they are attempting to shift away from using cobalt in their batteries, using a more advanced version of Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries starting in their Chinese market. However, In order to ensure a steady supply of cobalt while they make this transition, they\u2019ve entered an exclusive deal with Glencore. The company is known as one of the more ethical cobalt suppliers however in spite of this there is still evidence of child labor within Glencore\u2019s supply lines: [https:\/\/freedomcollaborative.org\/newsletter-archive\/a-swiss-company-profits-from-child-labour-and-perilous-conditions-in-a-bolivian-mine](https:\/\/freedomcollaborative.org\/newsletter-archive\/a-swiss-company-profits-from-child-labour-and-perilous-conditions-in-a-bolivian-mine)\n\nAnalysis:\n\nIt seems Tesla is attempting to faze out cobalt use as much as they can without affecting their profit margins. Clearly, the continual use of it is still immoral and this is a valid criticism of Musk and Tesla, However, Tesla isn\u2019t as utterly uncaring about the issue as people claim.\n\nElon musk tax evasion:\n\n[https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/12\/22\/elon-musk-says-his-wealth-isnt-a-deep-mystery-his-taxes-are-simple.html](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/12\/22\/elon-musk-says-his-wealth-isnt-a-deep-mystery-his-taxes-are-simple.html)\n\nMath is simple, most of Elon's net worth is tesla stock which is considered unrealized gains and isn\u2019t taxed which explains the discrepancy between his net worth and taxes. If you owned stocks, bitcoin, or any other asset that can increase in value then you wouldn\u2019t pay taxes on it either. The reason he didn't pay taxes in 2018 is that he accidentally overpaid in 2017.","228":"[removed]","229":"They're violent wife beating racist petty tyrants who kill a shitload of people and have no regard for the people they are supposedly there to protect. They have a gang mentality. Individual officers who are \"good\" are still enabling the behavior of the other scum and upholding unjust laws and an unjust system.","230":"No one wants to be labeled negatively for their views, especially in the political atmosphere. Furthermore, no one wants to be labeled negatively for their political views when it's mostly considered an anomaly in their communities. This argument obviously applies to minorities, particularly racial, ethnic, and religious who vote Republican and not Democrat. When they usually do that, they're labeled as Uncle Toms, sellouts, etc. In particular, these terms are mostly applied to Blacks, but they're also labeled towards others as well. The reason is that their critics view the Republican Party as detrimental in their eyes in terms of race, gender, religion, etc. This has led to a lot of Conservatives to call the people who use such terms as racists. I overall agree that no one should label someone who has different views as you by a certain expression. You can debate them but it shouldn't get to the point that you have to start name-calling. That being said, there's an obvious reason why they use these terms and for the most part, they do have a legitimate point. If they want this to stop, this is what Minority Conservatives need to do to prevent it from continuing.\n\nLet's start off by saying that individualism and personal responsibility are overall great notions. No one wants to live a life of being a victim and being dependent all the time. Everyone wants to be successful. But what happens if it gets to a point that you make blanket statements associating negative stereotypes with the broader community that you're supposed to uplift and inspire so they can succeed just as much as you do? Obviously, people will get offended and you will be rightfully called out for it. As a result, you will not be considered a great role model in their eyes.\n\nThe above argument is an example of the trap that many Minority Conservatives fall into. They use personal responsibility and individualism by making themselves look morally superior to others. This results in them constantly bashing their community by associating negative stereotypes about them, including people who don't fit such stereotypes. They say things like they have a victim or plantation mentality, are obsessed with complaining all the time, are lazy, incompetent, want freebies, and constantly make poor choices like committing crime, doing drugs, skipping school, joining gangs, having out-of-wedlock children, etc. That is why they're always unsuccessful. With that type of condescending attitude, how do you think you'll win over your community like that? Furthermore, they and the majority of their fellow Conservatives (majority of them being White) view Minorities through the lens of poverty if they vote Democrat and if they're successful, work hard, do well in school, have a decent income, have a strong family background, avoid gang activity, don't use drugs, etc., they vote Republican. There are a lot of successful minorities in America who fit all these categories and they don't vote Republican. Furthermore, there are a lot of prosperous Middle and Upper-Class neighborhoods and suburbs in America populated by minorities who tend to lean Democrat. What do they have to say about that? Are they existent to them or not? Because it doesn't sound like they are.\n\nAnother argument that I want to make in regards to the statement I wrote above is that Conservatives will be the first to accuse Liberals of thinking minorities are a monolith who should think one way. But what they fail to realize is that they're doing the exact same thing. The Minority Conservatives are just as guilty of doing that as well. In fact, they're the repeat offenders of it. Overall, they think that the minorities are incapable of thinking for themselves. I really can't help but ask them if they see the hilarious and blatant irony in their arguments cause it seems like they don't. But hey, projection is their jam.\n\nTo close off, my message to all the current and incoming Minority Conservatives is this: If you don't want to be called Uncle Tom, don't mistake Personal Responsibility and Individualism for putting down your own race, religion, etc. in order to gain acceptance from the majority, let alone the minority. It doesn't matter if you're White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, etc. It's cringeworthy and surprisingly enough, it's considered an example of shameless pandering. Not only that, you're creating new stereotypes of your demographic that are just as bad as the ones you claim to be against. We all know how you and the rest of your fellow White Conservatives love to criticize Liberal-leaning Whites for being self-loathing and having White Guilt and going further by referring to them as cucks, beta males, soyboys, girly boys, brown nosers, coal burners, etc. (all of which are similar in context to Uncle Tom and should be dubbed racist as well). I agree, it's just as cringeworthy. But that doesn't mean you should accept Minority Self-Loathing as well as Minority Guilt either, whether it be Black Guilt, Hispanic Guilt, Jewish Guilt, and Muslim Guilt. If you really want to bring change, don't be condescending to your audience. You're meant to be role models not grifters. And since Conservatives claim to not see color and see individualism, don't generalize your audience as a whole. Many of the Conservative outlets that you supposedly follow like Fox News and Breitbart have a tendency of looking down on minorities and generalizing them a lot instead of viewing them as individuals as they claim to believe, in particular the former when it comes to crime committed by minorities. An obvious example being \"13%\". It definitely is possible to be a Minority Conservative while not being a total and complete sellout. Good Luck, you'll need it.","231":"OK, I've had this exact conversation enough times that I feel it is relevant to make a post about it.\n\nEvery once in awhile somebody will make the claim that \"the fact America elected Trump in 2016 I'd indicative of the fact that Americans are tired of woke BS\" or some other variation of that claim.\n\nAnd then somebody else will come along and point out that \"well it's not really indicative of the way Americans feel because most Americans voted against Trump\" \n\nAnd then the original person or some other conservative will jump in to point out that \"the popular vote doesn't decide the election\"\n\nYes, of course that's true, but that's not what the conversation was about.

The worst time to explain periods to young girls would be after they took place because they wouldn't understand it if no one told them.

The best time to inform on that particular issue would be before it happens so that they know it's normal. \n\nWhat reasons would it not apply in this case?

Knowing that only the people who were there while place was up made it so special, so when people are preserving its existence, it feels a little tainting.","236":" \n\nBefore I start I want to say something: I am an Israeli, and half Jewish Ukrainian from my father side who was born in Ukraine and his mother being a holocaust survivor. I do not hate Ukraine or the Ukrainian people, nor do I hate Russia or the Russian people. This isn't about me hating Ukraine, but it does about me seeing what the likely future will be for Ukraine. I could be wrong, but you know.  \n\n\nHere's what I think will happened:\n\nIf, and its a big if, Ukraine does get Donetsk, Luhansk and Crimea back people will start complain about Ukraine the same way they do on Israel and the west bank.\n\nYesterday, Zelensky said in an interview that Ukraine will become a big Israel and not like the liberal western European countries.\n\nWhat he meant by this was that Ukraine will start to militarize and develop its own weaponry that fits its needs as well as start doing policies like mandatory service, big defense budget etc.\n\nBut what will also happened is that Ukrainian society will also become much alike Israeli society. I wont go over about everything it means but for our purpose this means that Ukrainian society will be more acceptable towards losing liberties if it means security, and it makes since because we Israelis were too willing to give up on liberties like with the mandatory service in the IDF because it means that our country will be safe, that what he meant by not wanting to be liberal western country.\n\nAnd another thing that will happened to Ukrainian society is that it will become more paranoid, after all, it was Russian citizens from your country who revolted and joined sides with Russia and those separatists were Russians, and I dont really think anyone gonna mind the amount of Russians who did not support the separatists, because after all, if they wanted to live in Ukraine they should have packed their bags and migrated to their country. They would pretty much give the \"compliance is soft support\" like they did with the Russians who live in Russia and dont overthrow their government since you know, they revolted and overthrew their government back in 2014. This isn't me saying that Ukrainian society will be racist, its just it will be more of \"respect and suspect\" kind of deal, like we have with the non Bedouin Israeli Arabs.\n\nSo what will happened? Well, first there will be marshal law across those liberated places, then, the population will be under surveillance and be suspected in case they ever try to separate again, which could happened since any separatist with luck that had managed to run way before hand will most likely be a terrorist and attack across the border like the Palestinian Fedayeen. Next, the Russian speaking population will start to feel antagonized and would wish for Russian liberation back again, or better yet they would form their own nationalism that is distinct enough from Ukraine and Russia. Golda Meir said that Palestinians dont exist but she was half true at her time, those countries in the middle east has only existed for around 20-30 years at this point and only existed cause a European diplomat said so.\n\nNext, those liberated areas will start harboring terrorist organizations disguised as Russian liberation organization or LLO if you want. A situation that will force the Ukrainian army to deploy troops there to arrest and eliminate those terrorist cells, and since this is soldiers v terrorists in urban environment, civilians will get killed. Ukrainian soldier killed them? Terrorist? Doesn't matter he's a martyr from now on.\n\nAll these things and more will probably lead to a Russian intifada, that will force Ukraine to go hard against those terrorists, and if a peace deal is ever made with that LLO, it would probably be sort lived as this deal will only give whoever in charge of that LLO a cover for any illegal activities he might want to do.\n\nAnd we forgot about Ukrainian people, who some will probably migrate back to these regions, putting them in conflict with the local population who would look at them as settlers that try to destroy the identity of the region.\n\nAnd add to that the fact that Russia, while weak diplomatically, could still recover from this war and gain allies diplomatically, allies that could antagonize Ukraine in the UN. Not to mention all the propaganda it still could employ, showing pics of dead children in Donetsk and saying \"this is what Ukrainian troops do\" while completely ignoring the fact there was an ambush of Russian terrorists on Ukrainian soldiers who caused a stray bullet to kill the kid.\n\nAnd you wondering how will the people of Ukraine will react to all of these? The same way we react in Israel. When we hear news about dead terrorist in Jenin we celebrate that a massacre has been avoided, when we think about the soldiers in the west bank we think of the separation wall (which is actually most just fence but still) we think of the fact that after construction it lowered the terrorists attack rate by 90% When we remember the disengagement from Gaza with all these settlers we think that they were, for a lack of a better term, ungrateful bastards who elected a terrorist group that shouldn't have been on the ballot in the first place, a group that launched rockets at our cities from hospitals and schools, which makes it even harder to pull the trigger when it comes to air strikes, heck we had to invent roof knocking with bombs.\n\nAnd why can we put up with all this things like mandatory service, the government being able to see what's on your phone at any time, delays of security when going to the airport? High budget for the armed forces? Any killing of Palestinians (innocent or guilty) Because in our society, that will soon become Ukrainian society too, security is above all else, because its better to be safe now and sorry later, because you cannot allow yourself to lose the next war because then you wont even have a country.\n\nSo now you got all of these factors, all the terrorism, nationalistic people that want security, propaganda machine of Russia, separatists who wished to break away. And now tell me reddit wont flood with \"free Donetsk\" And Al Jazeera will call for Zelensky to be brought to the Hauge.\n\nthe internet will call out Ukraine as an apartheid for not letting Russians, who I should remind you were separatists not so long ago, be completely free and that they should \"break the chains\".\n\nAnd Putin and Russia?

I completely cut pornography out of my life and I can confirm that my non-smoking friends who watch pornography are all much less socially adjusted, less confident, less mentally healthy and even less physically healthy than I am. Their skin is worse than mine, they are academically less successful and their are generally overweight.\n\nI understand that smoking of cigarettes has been linked to various ailments but pornography is certainly the greater evil, judging by its impacts on people in my own life. Most rapists and serial killers are consumers of pornography. For example, Wayne Couzens was a police officer in my country who murdered an innocent woman, and it was later proven that he and his friends routinely consumed violent porn.\n\nIn the 1950s, when pornography was much lighter and much harder to access than today, and when most men smoked cigarettes, the streets were safe. Women felt safe going out at night, these days many women don't and this is because of how pornography affects the brain (just to clarify I'm not saying that women who watch porn are more afraid of it, more that there are more violent rapists and murderers out there today because men who watch porn are more likely to commit these acts due to how the porn affects their brains).

We have been conditioned to want a materialistic, shallow, and hypercapitalist lifestyle and world order by propaganda from plutocratic states and megacorporations.\n\nWe do not have real democracy, certainly not where I live in the US, and not even really in Europe. Democracy requires true equality, which no modern capitalist \"democracy\" possesses, by virtue of the fact every country, even the relatively \"egalitarian\" Scandinavian social democracies, have people far wealthier and disproportionately influential than any others. In the US, it is absurd to claim we have \"democracy\" when the two-party system is little more than a neoliberal puppet of the capitalist class; the idea the average citizen, no matter how thoughtful or rational their ideas are, has any chance of being acknowledged on anything more than a token handshake or vague and empty response from his representative's staffers, is absurd. Don't get me wrong, I love our constitutional civil liberties, but time and time again, we see these rights\u2014even when the constitution is very clear from a frank and common-sense perspective\u2014be ignored or rationalized away if they are too inconvenient for the ruling class: NSA warrantless mass surveillance, internal border checkpoints, bans on civilian ownership of fully-automatic weapons (\"shall not be infringed\"), solitary confinement and other torture (\"cruel and unusual punishment\"), perpetual copyright, de facto wars without congressional approval, and holding prisoners without trial, all of these are very clearly unconstitutional to anyone with high school education in the English language who is being honest to themselves, yet all are rationalized and excused away be the courts nonetheless. Why? Because an entrenched elite *always* continually accumulates more and more power, and civil liberties, by there very nature liberties *the government* \"guarantees\" to not infringe, are inherently on very shaky ground. This is true of every state society, including Iceland, New Zealand, Sweden, and other societies we think of as near perfect democracies. Guess what? Wiemar Germany and Chile under Allende were \"thriving constitutional democracies, \"and yet they too fell to brutal dictatorial thugs.\n\nAn example of a true democracy would be the Iroquoian confederacies of the Northeastearn Woodlands prior to European destruction: Lack of significant financial inequality, a class system, presence of regular community meetings between true equals, and perhaps most importantly, the right to leave one's community or disobey orders from the Sachem or Clan Mother. Yes, there were exceptions to these rules, such as the Mourning Wars where captives were taken, and a maniac would be restrained or probably killed if s\/he caused danger or severe disturbance. Obviously their societies were hardly perfect, but then you can note South Korea is hardly perfect from the standpoint of a truly democratic society, yet for a North Korean it would seem almost unimaginably good by comparison. But the Wyandot, Iroquois, and Neutral Nations had no prisons, no entrenched class system, and no significant economic inequality. No Iroquoian man, woman, or child had to worry about being evicted from their home if they couldn't pay rent, suck up to a boss they hate because they have to pay back their student loan debts. And while the False Face Society was very secretive, unlike the NSA, the KGB, or MI5 members of the False Face Society weren't constantly watching you in your longhouse, when you went hunting, or listening to your conversations with your family or friends. And the False Face Society\u2014or indeed, the Grand Council itself\u2014didn't force you to fork over 30% of your corn crop or catch in deer meat every year and send heavily-armed men to drag you out of your corn field when you least expected it and put you in a cage if you refused, and if you physically resisted these heavily-armed men you wouldn't be locked up in the cage for still longer or even killed on the spot.\n\nTo live in a world without this oppression, you need to get rid of centralization. Centralization isn't just in the state; our economic and technological system, by virtue of the phenomenal level of specialization and resources required to make modern electronics,  which modern aircraft, automobiles, agriculture, energy grids, factories, food production\u2014including so called \"green\" foods like Beyond and Impossible Ersatz meat\u2014requires centralization. Centralization inherently breeds hierarchy, and hence we'd be back to being slaves of the ruling class and the state, maybe in some different form, i.e. right-libertarian corporatocracy or a quasi-pharoanic religious autocracy, but it will *inevitably* reemerge.\n\nOne of the most iron laws of history is this: Every time a leader or small elite are trusted with power, especially when massive amounts of theorizing and selecting the \"benevolent\" monarch or dictator, or \"strong\" checks and balances, things will return to a similarly highly unequal, unjust, and rigged system as the old one in time, unless the new system becomes even worse. The only societal systems which truly work over the long-term are stateless societies: Witness Native Californians, Australian Aborigines, Iroquoian and Algonquian peoples, and Khoisan bands in Southern Africa. Or, the longevity of modern Pueblo villages compared to the brief glory and then collapse of the Chacoan regime.\n\nIn time, if we don't stop this ship from sailing into the rock, it *will* be too late, because technology *will* become too advanced to stop. Which brings me to my last, and perhaps gravest, concern: AI. In the times of the Haitian Revolution, if enough people got really really mad, the weapons of the elite were not so overwhelmingly superior a mass of the poor, working class, and underclasses could simply overpower them. Also, surveillance in even the most despotic preindustrial states pales in comparison to the what your boss can see on \"your\" company phone from his desk at work, let alone the truly behemoth power of the supercomputers of modern militaries and intelligence agencies. AI will either lead to one or two outcomes, probably both, in order: It will enable a totalitarian system where the elite enjoy near absolute power and luxury; and\/or it will ultimately overthrow *all* mankind, and possibly destroy all life on Earth in an endless quest for resources, depending on its fundamentally inhumane motives.\n\nThe only long term solution I can see is this: We have to overthrow the techno-capitalist system and adopt a stateless, sustainable agrarian system of societies the world over. This system will not be uniform, far from it. I can easily see dry coastal areas being based on fisheries and aquaculture, not unlike what the Ancient Peruvians and Northwest Coast Peoples relied on; forest, wetland, and other well-watered areas being covered in vast forest gardens with many types of small livestock, fish, insects, and fungi being part of the local diets; dry and mediterranean areas being based on transhumance or clever irrigated agriculture, perhaps like the systems the Pueblo peoples have perfected over the centuries; boreal forests, tundra, and polar areas focused on reindeer or yak herding, low-input forest gardening systems, or hunter-gatherer ways.\n\nI do not support returning to a purely hunter-gather existence. This is unjust, because it requires almost everyone on Earth to starve to death. It is a false dichotomy, because many \"hunter-gatherer\" cultures like the Owens Valley Paiute, California natives, and even Australian Aborigines (read *Dark Emu*) practised what was basically equivalent to agriculture, just not *European* field and monoculture-based agriculture. Not to mention many, *many* long-standing, largely egalitarian traditional societies which practised what is indisputably agriculture, such as the New Guineans, the Puebloans, Iroquoians, many Amazonian peoples, and peoples of the Matrilineal Belt of Africa.\n\nThis does not mean we should reject *all* technology. Traditional systems of irrigation, metallurgy, water and wind mills, paper, printing presses, concrete, etc. and other technologies are objectively different from modern petrol engines, jumbo jets, spacecraft, superalloys, or nanotechnology in that they can be very easily decentralized. To make concrete all that is needed is lime, aggregate, and baked clay\u2014indeed, several traditional societies invented just this process. Ironworking is a hallmark of tribal Bantu Africa. Paper requires only fibre, water, and lye, the last of which can be easily obtained from burning seaweed, coastal plants, or certain trees.\n\nWe must make this transition now before it is too late. We must revitalize ourselves, and renew Mother Earth.","269":"[deleted]","270":"It's pretty simple, if you support the police you are supporting politcal violence. It's not often called that because it's against the interests of the state but its true on its face.

Next time you want to condemn antifa for political violence, just admit that you think your politcal violence if justified and stop pretending you can disavow political violence as a whole. \n\nThe same problem occurs with the military and borders. Borders require politcal violence to exist. Most actions by militaries are terrorism, they are purposely enacted to create fear in their victims. Guantanamo bay, drone strikes, sanctions all accomplish this.\n\nIf you support capitalism, you are supporting constant propaganda in your daily life.

why you may happen across cats that have been hit by cars far more than dogs? because people prefer dogs. because dogs, for a particular reason, are viewed as \"better.\" i've seen so many people say that \"if you're not a dog person then you're a psychopath.\" and there's also so many negative stigmas surrounding cat lovers aka \"the crazy cat lady\" or \"witches and cats\" etc. people adopt and breed dogs endlessly, while cats are left out on the streets to fend for themselves. but honestly, i see more red flags with being a dog person. dogs are some of, if not *the* *most* submissive animals on the planet. they cater to your every demand, they flood you with attention and love, they submit to you in every way, they struggle to learn boundaries - and they've been genetically designed to be this way... to submit to humans. im sorry, but it's **weird.** if you hate cats because they're independent and think for themselves, then in my opinion *that's* more alarming... to hate something that doesn't submit to you.\n\n- (EDIT) dogs pose a bigger threat to humans. their bites are stronger, and when aggressive they can actually severely injure and even *kill* people. i've seen so many articles and news clips of dogs attacking, injuring, and killing humans. i've even heard of a dog biting off a toddler's arm, or a pack of dogs dragging someone into a ditch and chewing off their face. dogs are more violent, and some are even bred to be fighters. i've personally witnessed multiple dogs become aggressive and bite or slash open their owners, and other people around them, to the point of drawing blood and punching holes into the people's skin with their teeth.\n\nall around cats are just better in so many ways.\n\nEDIT: to those of you bringing up the brain fungus argument, more than a third of the world population has this brain fungus you speak of. studies have shown that most, nearly all, people who have this brain fungus are not affected by it at all. and cat owners aren't the only ones who have it.\n\nfrom an article on inverse, \"These findings go far beyond cat lovers. Researchers say understanding microglia's defense capabilities could lead to better ways of treating other brain infections, including neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, and autoimmune disorders, like multiple sclerosis and strokes.\" so this brain fungus, and our ability to fight it, is actually helping researchers and scientists be able to study and better understand other neurological diseases\/ailments that need a cure.","274":"Not only did they make themselves the most important thing at the Oscars, but philosophically, I agree with both sides.

Everybody was smiling. Will laughed, Chris laughed, we laughed. This is a win-win-win for everybody!","275":"This opinion obviously applies to the current situation we have regarding COVID-19. With many precautions being implemented over the past several months in order to combat the virus, there's been some people out there who think they are so entitled to dismiss the severity of it, whether it be masks, vaccines, mandates, social distancing, etc. Instead, they claim to rely on their immune system, which in my opinion isn't really enough to combat it and it shows. As a result, they resort to calling those who heed to such precautions as sheep and lab rats. They even go further by harassing and threatening doctors who do their job to help cure patients affected by it as well as parents who decide to mask their children as child-abusers to comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust. And for the most part, these people obviously tend to be Conservative and are unvaccinated. But at the end of the day, who is getting affected and dying? The Unvaccinated or Vaccinated? The answer for the most part is the Unvaccinated. Why do you think that is? Obviously because they're constantly being fed propaganda and misinformation. Now, these people are suffering the consequences of their actions and their friends and family suffer as well. If anything, it seems to me that these people are the real sheep not the ones who they constantly accuse of. These are the same people who also for the most part don't tend to take any personal responsibility, especially since I mentioned before, the victims are mostly Conservative and personal responsibility is one of its main tenets. In conclusion, the real sheep who are being sent to the slaughter are the unvaccinated. Their constant obsession with owning the libs in the name of freedom have all but backfired. Hell, even our former president admitted that the unvaccinated are dying at a higher rate than those who are and he said it to a Conservative pundit straight to her face. He even got booed at a rally for taking the vaccine and even recommended his base to take it to no avail. Two examples that validate my opinion on this issue are Kelly Ernby and Robert Lamay.\n\nKelly Ernby, a former California prosecutor rallied against Covid vaccine precautions comparing it to socialism. She died of COVID complications in early January at the age of 46 setting off a chain reaction between the vax and antivax movements. Now, let's get to the next and main one: Robert Lamay. This death by far is one of the worst deaths of them both. This former Washington State Trooper had to retire early back in October due to his unvaccinated status and his criticism of the state's Democratic governor made him a viral sensation. He even had an interview with Fox News over it, which is pretty ironic since the studio has strict vaccine mandates themselves and 90% of their staff is vaccinated. This is clearly obvious over the fact that the interview he conducted with them took place in his squad car. Fast forward to February and he's dead as a doornail at age 50 from COVID and he leaves behind a wife and 4 children. Meanwhile, the studio for the most part remained silent.\n\nSo yeah, pretty much. The people who accuse others of being sheep are in reality the biggest sheep of them all. Now the question remains: Should we have empathy for them or not if they get affected and die? Obviously, we should. No death should be mocked. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't be critical of them. We definitely should because they made a terrible and fatal mistake, one that was easily preventable and they need to be called out on that. Their deaths should also serve as a reminder of what could happen if others made the same mistake and to prevent it from happening. What's even frustrating is that the ignorance of these people is only making it harder to stop the virus. Like I said, personal responsibility and it goes both ways. Whether it be complying with the police as some people cry out, the same logic applies here. Furthermore, dying to own the Libs is not fighting for your freedom. It's fighting for stupidity. It also dramatically decreases your political base.","276":"What a change three weeks make for the savages of reddit.

[https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/05\/02\/oscars-2021-nielsen-data-shows-viewers-have-lost-interest-in-award-shows.html](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/05\/02\/oscars-2021-nielsen-data-shows-viewers-have-lost-interest-in-award-shows.html) There was a 51% drop in viewership from 2020. The Oscars are irrelevant, no one cares anymore. How do you regain popularity in the media? Well just have some scripted dramatic event happen and SUDDENLY, EVERYONE on social media just HAS to post about your irrelevant award show and voice their very important opinion on the \"oh em gee\" crazy thing that happened! \"Well they had beef in the past-\" No, you're just gullible.\n\nEdit: They will use this to make the Oscars relevant next year. Just before the Oscars next year, this will trend, everyone will talk about the Oscars, and suddenly an award show that was on life support for interest will be in the limelight again. Not to mention Chris Rock is going on tour next month, great way to get him into the spotlight and promote him since he had become pretty irrelevant before the slap.","280":"Fact is, if Will Smith was a White actor, *any\" White actor, he would be being cancelled as we speak. They'd be screaming about 'Toxic Masculinity', insisting on Anger Management classes in order to keep his Oscar, and of course, chalk it all up to 'Systemic Racism'. Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson would be calling for the gas chamber. His career would be ruined. I always knew Will Smith was a piece of garbage. Tonight he proved it.\n\nThis was a harmless joke that everybody snickered at.\n\nAnybody defending Smith is a hypocrite and a fraud.","281":"I don't condone Will Smith attacking Chris Rock. I want to be clear on that. However, I want to be absolutely clear when I say that Will and Jada Smith have received far more criticism than is warranted because of an unorthodox relationship. History will remember them as being ahead of the curve. Not every relationship needs to be polyamorous or open, but shitting on Will at every turn for HIS decision to stay with Jada is none of anyone's damn business, and it's completely unwarranted. \n\nThe fact that people need to constantly draw attention to an extremely personal part of someone's life is not only sad, it's cowardly. People did this for years to Taylor Swift and Britney Spears, only for them to be vindicated years later. Calling Jada a whore is not only misogynistic, but I would argue that it has roots in racism as well. Charlie Sheen had a polyamorous relationship with his \"goddesses\" before his drug-fueled, egomaniacal downfall, but people's perception of him then was largely positive, and certainly never devolved into hurling slurs and lowbrow jokes at him.\n\nI felt the need to write about this because everyone is calling Will Smith crazy and a simp, cuck, whatever other incel insult, and so on. Was he out of line for assaulting Chris Rock? Sure he was. Was it a crime? Of course. Will he face consequences? Not likely, given his fame and fortune. Despite all that though, what we witnessed last night was someone near their breaking point and lashing out. The Smiths, for all their faults and quality of entertainment (I personally don't like Will's movies), do not deserve the vitriol and negativity that the internet is spewing their way. Idk I just felt like I should say something and this is the right subreddit to do it in.","282":"So Will smith's original claim to fame was being the \"clean\" rapper. No foul language and was against the glorification of violence. \n\nYet it's OK to slap a comedian if he pokes a bit of fun at your wife. \n\nIt's all about tone. Chris Rock wasn't being malicious, he was telling a joke. Whether it was a good joke is entirely up to the audience. \n\nHonestly if there is no repercussions for the actions of this we may as well toss the whole justice system. \n\nCelebrities, get over yourselves. Jokes are jokes, folks.","283":"[removed]","284":"[deleted]","285":"at the time i am writing this post, the current [top post in the front page](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/trueunpopularopinion\/comments\/tq6x75) is about how will smith wouldn't get away with slapping chris rock if he was white.\n\nwhat the hell is going on in this place? someone watched a man slap another man, and the first thing that came to their mind was that he wouldn't get away with it if he was white? and people agreed with this ridiculous opinion, even though race had absolutely nothing to do with the incident? and you people have the fucking gall to accuse leftists of being obsessed with race?\n\nif you agreed with that opinion, you should honestly take a look at yourself. it is sad that people in this place have come to the point that they're now finding ways to feel persecuted even when they're not mentioned or even hinted at. or who knows, maybe they feel persecuted because they're not the center of attention. regardless, you should be ashamed of yourselves.","286":"[removed]","287":"I don't think anyone should ever have suffer concerted efforts that are aimed at changing their sexuality or gender. Such efforts are so immoral and vile in so many ways that I think it would make sense if any attempts made by a person to change a person's sexuality or gender should be illegal. This would be especially punishable for young people and children.","288":"Like the title says, they're just butthurt assholes who probably got arrested for speeding, vandalism, or other minor offenses and instead of admitting that they have fucked up and broke a law or rule, they spend said anger to search for every excuse imaginable to hate on the police and to get away with breaking said minor laws and\/or rules. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore any of you say that I'm a blind bootlicker, yes. The police needs a reform to weed out bad people and to make sure that they are properly rewarded for their service alongside with punishing those who break the laws.","289":"We set ourselves up for a natural conflict with this lie, not to mention all the \"Bridezilla\" levels of expectations.\n\nYour wedding day is NOT your day.  The wedding and the reception are the day where you and your SO formally announce your union to the community and the community comes to witness it.\n\nThis is a party *for the community*.  Not for you.  That's why everybody planning it goes a little crazy trying to get more people to come and make the attendees happy.  It's not to piss you off.  It's because that's what these events are FOR.\n\nSo do the Happy Couple get \"their day?\"  Of course!  *That's what the honeymoon is for.*\n\nThe wedding and the reception are for the community.  The honeymoon is for you.  We'll have a lot less bullshit drama if we stop confusing these things.","290":"In America, rich celebrities are above the law.  The rules don't apply to them.  They can violently assault another person in public, on video, and nothing  happens.  \n\nIf will Smith had been a black man instead of a rich celebrity, the police would have shot him 91 times.  In America the police are the judge, jury and executioner... for black people. \n\n\nWill Smith is lucky that he isn't a black man.  If he were, Chris Rock would have beat the fuck out of him right before the police executed him.","291":"I think that what Will Smith did was out of line. He was *laughing* at the joke until he looked at his cry baby wife and decided that he had to \u2018put things right\u2019.\n\nHis verbal abuse afterward was appalling.\n\nThat said, I dunno what Jada was sooking about. So she shaved her hair off before it could fall off, who cares?\nShe\u2019s had very short hair before, as you can see [here.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/OOjCDzg)\n\nShe was happy to shave her hair off in the past (and she did it several times) but now since it\u2019s falling out, she\u2019s somehow upset about it?\n\nBoth she and her husband need to grow the fuck up.","292":"[deleted]","293":"We all saw what happened. Chris Rock mocked Jada Smith, so her husband went up and slapped him. These two men know each other, they are in the same league. It was only a slap. I bet most of us here have been treated worse and the perpetrator faced 0 consequences. It's crazy to imagine it's the same as a stranger violently assaulting someone.","294":"[removed]","295":"Jada Smith suffers from an Autoimmune disease called Alopecia, which causes you to lose all your hair. And Chris rock made fun of her for it. It'd be like making fun of a cancer patient for having no hair.\n\nHe crossed a line and while maybe punching him was uncouth, Chris fucking deserved it and i'da done the same thing.\n\nAlopecia is a serious thing that hundreds of thousands of people suffer from. I get that it was just a joke. But it wasn't fucking funny. And the fact that people are acting like Will Smith is the asshole for defending his wife is absolutely backed up fuckwards and sideways.","296":"[deleted]","297":"[deleted]","298":" tonight is Oscar's night. as a huge movie buff, this is one of my personal favorite nights of the entire year. a night where the best movies of the previous year get honored for their writing, acting, directing, and others. for almost 100 years, the academy awards ceremony has been one of the biggest movie events of the year. as such, reddit\\`s attitude towards the academy awards is really disheartening.\n\nthe academy awards seems to be the only thing that reddit hates more than superhero movies. whenever I've made a post that involves the oscars, i\\`ve gotten at least one comment about how the oscars \"don\\`t matter\". earlier today, i made a post on [r\/askreddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askreddit\/) wherein i asked the people of that sub what movie they think will win best picture tonight. one of the comments said \"as if i care\".\n\ni really don\\`t get why people on reddit seem to have such a hate boner for the oscars. yes, there are snubs and some wins are undeserved but that\\`s the case with every award ceremony. i could say those same things about the grammies or the tonys or the eisners. everyone is going to have a different opinion. also, just because a movie won an award doesn\\`t mean you have to like it. for example, i don\\`t particularly care for shakespeare in love despite the fact that it won best picture. that\\`s how opinions work. everyone has one and no two people\\`s opinions will be exactly the same. or maybe it\\`s because the oscars have pretty much become a dick measuring contest as to who\\`s more liberal. i will admit that the virtue signaling in the oscar is a bit annoying(and that\\`s coming from a liberal). however, all art is political to a certain extent and movies are art. yes, i could do without \"the police will kill three people\" but, in a world where pretty much all art is political, a bit of that is unavoidable.\n\ni love the academy awards and i watch it every year. not only is it exciting to see movies that i really like be nominated for and even win awards, but there is a lot of emotion and enjoyment to be had. i am left awe struck at the performances from the musical artists and am left in tears after the in memorium segment. tonight, as i always have, i will tune in at 8:00 and will watch the ceremony in it\\`s entirity. because i love the oscars.","299":"Defending your country from an invasion is heroic, fighting for imperialism isn't. The US military exists more to further American hegemony than to defend it from real threats. This doesn't mean that individual soldiers are bad people, anymore than police officers are. In both cases it is the function they perform that is harmful.","300":"Basically the title - I can think of many cases where it makes sense to hide (or even entirely disable) downvotes.\n\nFor one thing, consider Reddit itself - fully half of the super-downvoted posts I see have nothing wrong content-wise, the opinion just goes against the grain of the subreddit it is in, so pissy members downvote it into oblivion\n\nOn the other hand, I have personally made some super acerbic comments that by rights should have been downvoted, and yet were upvoted sky-high\n\nUntil people learn that the downvote button isn't the \"this hurt my feewings\" button (paging r\/conservative), it can make sense to disable downvotes","301":"The bill doesn't just ban it up until third grade. Right after the text saying that, there's text saying,\" or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201d The entire thing is deliberately written to be as vague and subjective as possible in order to scare teachers into never exposing children to the idea that gay people exist\n\nChildren are already exposed to the idea that straight people exist before third grade. The idea that that's ok but children finding out about the existence of LGBT people isn't, is hypocritical.

But I don't see hearing someone acknowlege the existence of LGBT people to be the same thing","302":"Posting here because the mods of r\/unpopularopinion banned me and removed my post for posting an actual unpopular opinion. Text is copied.\n\nLet me preface this by saying I am completely straight and am attracted to women. However, the look of vaginas is a massive turnoff, it looks like an open wound and thinking about it bleeding every month, why would anyone want to put their mouth down there?\n\nAnyway, boobs and ass are great. Vagina not so much\n\nEdit: Since 98% of the comments are clearly missing the point of my post or calling me gay (or both), let me clarify dick and balls are not attractive in the slightest either\n\nI didn\u2019t mention the male genitalia because my post was about attraction to females, and how the vagina is really not a turn on for me, especially compared to other parts on a woman.\n\nBut go ahead and keep missing the point","303":"TERFs choose their own definition for a woman, so I am choosing my own definition for being a feminist. How can one be a feminist when they exclude women? I don't care you don't consider them that, I do and my definition of what makes a feminist, the most important aspect is to support all women and children.\n\nThey are not feminists, not radical if you include their male counterparts the transphobes.

First off, citing the dictionary definition of a word is the weakest possible argument to make in literally any case and is laughable. I regret to inform you that it takes a little more effort than reading the first definition you see on Google to come up with a genuine understanding of any abstract concept. For those who love to appeal to the \u201cdefinition of racism\u201d, I submit to you the comprehensive meaning of the word as detailed by the [NASP](https:\/\/www.nasponline.org\/x26830.xml). It is actually *you* who is changing definitions to fit your perspective, not the other way around.\n\nRedditors argue ad nauseam that racism = discrimination on the basis of race, perceived racial superiority, etc. towards someone else. While half true, the most fundamental aspect of the concept is missing from this definition, resulting in a gross oversimplification that leaves us with a definition much more closely related to racial prejudice rather than racism. As per its sociological application, in order for prejudice to be considered racism, there must be a system and institutions in place with which the dominant group (whites) can benefit from and leverage power over minority or marginalized groups. This is readily observable in the U.S through our policies (Jim Crow, redlining, [the war on drugs](https:\/\/www.brennancenter.org\/our-work\/analysis-opinion\/race-mass-incarceration-and-disastrous-war-drugs)), hiring practices, (applicants with stereotypically white names are hired more frequently over applicants with stereotypically black names, despite the same [qualifications](https:\/\/hbswk.hbs.edu\/item\/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews)), the [police system](https:\/\/www.ppic.org\/publication\/racial-disparities-in-law-enforcement-stops\/), and a laundry list of many others. \n\nThis is the foundation on which racism and racist institutions are built\u2014 a system which whites have never suffered at the hands of and never will. And no, systemic racism and racism are no different. They are the same concept, as one cannot exist without the other. There absolutely cannot be any racism without a power dynamic in play. White people have not and will never experience obstacles or oppression at the macro-level to the degree that POC have. The [absence of power](https:\/\/www.aclrc.com\/myth-of-reverse-racism) amounts to nothing more than an exchange of mean words. Prejudice? Yes. Discrimination? Sure. Racism? Not even close."},"comments":{"0":"<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777B3CD860>","1":"<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at
