For how much we hear about how the system is racist and defends white supremacy. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE SYSTEM IS. or for that matter how it is racist. DEFINE YOUR TERMS.

If Kyle really did pose a big of a threat to the area, then why would they risk a fire fight with so many innocent people around them? \n\nThis isn\u2019t some novel concept, it\u2019s basic common sense which literally every kid who went through the American school system had to learn. If there\u2019s an active shooter, you run away, simple as that. \n\nHell, I am pretty sure they weren\u2019t even expecting him to fire back given how he was running away from them\u2026. \n\nMy guess is that once they cornered Kyle and he was forced to retaliate then Grosskreutz made up the bullshit about \u201ctrying to protect others\u201d when he realized that now there are investigations open around what was going on and was trying to cover his own ass beyond anything else.","4":"[deleted]","5":"","6":"[removed]","7":"If you were following the Rittenhouse trial you probably saw the incident where Jesse Klein (Maserati Mike) showed up outside the courthouse with an AR and the police made him leave.  Yes I\u2019m well aware that the legal grounds for making him leave was the 1,000 feet of a school, don\u2019t waste your breath talking about it.  Something doesn\u2019t have to be illegal to be creating a dangerous situation and a public nuisance.  The police identified him as a threat to public safety so they found a legal reason to make him leave, they didn\u2019t come from the school they came from the courthouse.  They knew that Rittenhouse was instigating violence and creating a dangerous situation the night of the protest, they just didn\u2019t care.  Rittenhouse got off because an incompetent prosecutor brought murder instead of manslaughter and because of the politics of the moment.  He will most likely lose the civil case that Huber\u2019s family will inevitably bring and be thought off much like OJ Simpson, a bad guy that got off.","8":"","9":"[removed]","10":"First off, I know you're probably tired of Rittenhouse posts by now especially since a lot of them either aren't unpopular or even opinions. But I've had one since the trial started that fits both of those criteria. Sorry if it's already been posted.\n\nI know what you're thinking. \"You're a clown, that was the worst prosecution I've ever seen in my life, he brought up CoD, questioned his 5th amendment rights...etc\" Under normal circumstances I would agree with you, but this is probably the one exception. There was just no evidence, in a perfect world that isn't polarized and everything isn't political this case never makes it to trial. The first guy chased him and threatened to kill him, second guy assaulted him with a skateboard and the third guy was only shot AFTER he pointed his gun at Rittenhouse. That's important because the prosecution had nothing and he knew he had nothing but still had to do his job. His options were either A:Do legit nothing and just sit there, or B:Grasp at any straw he could I.E Call of duty, show the Jury how it feels to be on the other end of an AR15...etc. And I think he did a great job at grasping at straws, I mean the jury actually deliberated on it for more than a day, when I honestly thought it would take less than an hour at first. \n\nEveryone I've talked to either already knew Rittenhouse would be cleared of charges or realized it was self defense once they looked into the evidence themselves, and while most think he made some stupid fucking choices they all acknowledge that it was clearly self defense. Anyone who looks at the evidence can see it was self defense yet the Prosecutor still had to argue that it wasn't, it was unwinnable from day 1.\n\nI honestly believe that if you gave this case to any Prosecutor in America they wouldn't win it. This man was given an impossible task with a case that should have never made it to trial and he did a good job when you consider that he had next to nothing to work with.","11":"Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\n   I want to start this by saying I understand my bias. I've been living in Texas for as long as I can remember. I was raised a Christian and I still am a Christian. My family is all Christian and I've gone to church 95% of all the Sundays I've lived, although my faith still waivers every now and then so I guess I'm not super dedicated. I've tried to separate myself from my bias as well as I can but no one's perfect. I've also considered myself a right leaning centrist If that means anything.\n\n   So on to my point. I believe that if the mothers life is not in danger then abortion should not be legal. However, abortion can be considered in cases of rape. Abortion should not be considered in cases of incest unless it wasn't consensual. Abortion should be a last resort. Those are my thoughts.\n\n   I understand where people are coming from when they say that it's the mothers choice because; \"my body, my choice\". However I disagree. That lump of cells\/embryo\/first trimester\/fetus\/baby etc., Is a separate organism with its own DNA. And not just any organism. A HUMAN. No matter what you believe about a baby's consciousness, that baby will eventually become a person. So it's not \"your body\". \n\n   I feel like people are choosing to ignore this fact and are throwing aside their morals in pursuit of \"personal freedom\". Are we so bored that we're willing to kill people to find something to do?\n  \n   I feel like there's a solution we're all forgetting here. Talk. To. Some. One. That's it. Talk about your problem. If your not ready to have a baby and your condom broke or your birth control failed. Discuss it with your partner. If you can't agree on something go to a professional who can help. A doctor, Marriage\/relationship counselor, fucking gynecologist idk, dont just kill babies because it's inconvenient to you. If you can't talk to your partner because they took off or something discuss with a doctor or someone close to you that you trust. Like a parent or sibling or close friend.\n\n   If you were raped and don't think you can handle a child then discuss with a doctor, legal team, etc. Maybe you can have the child and put them up for adoption. Being in the shitty foster care system is better than not being given a chance at all.\n\n   In cases of incest that isn't rape then the proper punishment should be given to the parents of the child but abortion should still be a last resort. Custody can be given to grandparents or other family members. Adoption is still an option here too.\n\nThere are obviously an infinite amount of different circumstances that the mother of the child could be in so I'm willing to discuss in the comments, in fact I encourage it. I think we can all learn something when we stop and think instead of jumping to conclusions.\n\nI'm terrible at getting my thoughts across so I hope you understood me. Things sound great in my head and then I vomit words and hope they make sense.","12":"[removed]","13":"OMFG this is by far the worst emoji in all of history. No other one is even comparable whatsoever. Why do i think such a thing? Well, have you ever read a comment section before?

Namely, that one doesn't induce the situation they're trying to claim they acted in self-defense. There's been a slew of caselaw on that topic, but the one that sticks in my mind is the case of The People v Crosbie and Meehan, where a group of youths, having had one of the group beaten up earlier, wandered the street with weapons, specifically going to the area where the violence had taken place and where those they wanted to do violence against were. This provoked the other group as they intended, a fight started, and two were killed. The Court found, quickly enough, that actively putting yourself in a situation like that, especially where one has the intent to do violence, was self-inducement, and thus, the same defense couldn't be used here.\n\nIt's not hard to see that's what happened here. We have footage of Kyle Rittenhouse only a week or two before, proclaiming how he wished he had his gun as two law-breakers fled, as he'd love to shoot them. Then, Kyle Rittenhouse would later arm himself... and head to an area like this, with what the video evidence shows is a clear intent and desire to use that weapon. \n\nIt's this fact that confirms for us that this wasn't self-defense. Nothing forced Rittenhouse to kill, he actively sought out the opportunity to do so, and thus, regardless of the lengthy debate over the footage, it can't have been self-defense.","32":"**Disclaimer:** Of course this was not popular on unpopularopinions, and I don't expect it here either, since whenever it comes to people's comfort, ethics get the ass end of the deal\u2026\n\nMost germans didn't want to help jews during WW2 as to not make their lives more difficult and also they were promised their own financial situations would better if gotten rid of the jews.

I love LGBT people and can't stand homophobes, I think women's safety is very important, I think people should be able to wear whatever they want in public, etc. Of course, you might say that those aren't necessarily progressive views in the Western world, but in many parts of the world they would be considered progressive and even blasphemous.\n\nNow here's where I reach out to my fellow progressives - after all, we are generally the ones more in favour of higher rates of immigration. \n\nMany people will arrive from parts of the world where such progressive views are not tolerated. I recently saw a video of a woman in my country (the UK) getting told to cover up by an Arabic man as it offends his culture, while shopping in a supermarket (link posted below).\n\nhttps:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.mirror.co.uk\/news\/uk-news\/asda-worker-tried-kick-woman-25430343.amp\n\nNow my point is, I've noticed many progressives happily calling out such behaviour from homegrown citizens, but seem to turn a blind eye to behaviour from those originating from other parts of the world. I'm not saying we should be calling those people out specifically, I'm saying that if we don't recognise that such a culture clash can occur, we may see ourselves losing our relatively progressive society.\n\nI don't have a specific solution, but the first step is surely recognising the problem (and this isn't a swipe at immigrants, it's simply an observation of such culture clashes which of course may well happen when different cultures mix).","51":"Okay, so this thread is going to be full of technical facts, and it will be my attempt to educate some people in the mainstream space why they shouldn't *completely* dismiss crypto as a scam, or a ponzi-scheme.\n\nI firmly believe that the technology behind crypto, and many popular projects have already built infrastructure and systems that have significant value, the same way the internet has value or gaming items do. You may or may not believe that the entire world can change its ways and move to crypto, but at the very least after this you hopefully will agree that crypto has its place in creating a more open alternative to some systems.\n\nSince I'm invested in crypto myself, I want to make it very clear that if I mention any specific crypto projects, it isn't financial advice, nor are positive or negative mentions a reason to invest in them. Do your own research if you do want to invest into crypto, but any coins or tokens that get mentioned will simply be in this thread with the purpose of providing an example.\n\nMy goal here is to educate on the premise of how blockchains and crypto work, so that people understand, besides the millions of scams that do exist, there are great projects working on great things, and maybe some of you might be inclined to try out some projects without even expecting any gains!\n\n**So first of all, what are blockchains?**\n\nBlockchains are simply distributed ledgers and computing systems. Now those are two fancy words that essentially mean they are systems, spread across the globe, running on many computers and servers, that track data, as well as allow their users to perform any tasks defined within their specifications. This can be as simple as adding two numbers, or handling a *smart contract* that only pays out insurance money if certain requirements are met. We'll get back to these later.\n\nThe benefit of having all the data, and code, running on a distributed system, is that everything is transparent. This doesn't always mean that I can read how much of a certain crypto got sent or received from each wallet, but the code can verify that you're allowed to perform certain transactions, and this is done by multiple people to ensure that trust doesn't need to really exist, since a large portion of people running and validating the network need to agree. This makes blockchains trustless.\n\n**How does crypto play into this?**\n\nCryptocurrencies are coins or tokens built on top of blockchains. It's very important to understand the difference between a cryptocoin, and a cryptotoken.\n\nEach blockchain needs a way to incentivize those distributed computers and servers I mentioned. Since they're running the computational tasks, and storing all the data on the ledger, they get paid in a cryptocoin. For the Bitcoin network this is BTC, for Ethereum it's ETH, etc. Those fees are usually paid when a transaction is ran on the network, so i.e. if I send from my wallet to yours some ETH, then a transaction fee must be paid and a part of which gets paid to the miners that enabled this transaction to go through, the rest of the transaction fee is destroyed, making ETH deflationary in this case.\n\nThere's a lot more that can go into the economics of a cryptocoin, or token. Some of it I might bring up later. In any case, now to the tokens.\n\nTokens are representations of real-world assets, or completely digital assets, built on top of a blockchain. As they aren't used to pay transaction fees, and aren't built natively on the blockchain they reside on, we call them tokens instead of coins. This could even be something like a house deed, or the ownership certificate of a vehicle, etc. These tokens don't even need to only exist on one blockchain. They can be coded to exist on multiple, such as Solana, Ethereum and Cardano.\n\nNow, not all blockchains make it possible to create a token on their network. Each blockchain has its own approach, often giving the creator of a token a reason to pick one or the other blockchain for their project.\n\n**How can tokens help us?**\n\nWell, a big use-case I see in blockchain technology right now is the use of tokens, which is why it's getting a dedicated section. As I mentioned, tokens are just assets, either representing something in the real-world, or entirely digital. I can tokenize my house deed, as I mentioned, or generate a bunch of even tickets with the right blockchain. Then sell the whole thing digitally, in a trustless and low-fee manner compared to traditional centralized systems.\n\nThose are just some examples I wanted to quickly mention on how tokens can actually have real-world use. On top of that, think about the games we play. LoL accounts, among others, can be sold for thousands of dollars because of the items they possess. Now, some might call it a bubble, or simply dumb, but it shows, that we humans are capable of attributing arbitrary value, to the oddest of things. The same can be seen in certain artwork (IMO, but those buying the art probably see it in a very different light) and playing cards for soccer\/football or Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nAll those, more playful, systems, can be tokenized and gamified on blockchain as well. I can write a smart contract that generates a very specific set of cards, which are used in a PvP game, and the better a card's attributes are, the higher likelihood it has in winning a tournament. That's a very basic, and general example of what I'm trying to explain, but hopefully it makes sense.\n\n**What are smart contracts?**\n\nSmart contracts are what really make blockchains as capable as they are today, IMHO. A very straightforward explanation is that a smart contract is some code, that only does something when certain parameters are met. That's why it's called a smart contract, because it only executes its main task, after the contract is signed so to speak. Depending on the blockchain you're working on, smart contracts will have different capabilities, but there are some crazy use-cases for them that I bet some of you will find interesting.\n\nThis is where we get a bit more technical. To really understand how great a smart contract can be, you need to know that this code gets deployed on a blockchain by whoever created it, and gets a wallet address of its own just like you or I would on which it can accept transactions or even send them. This means smart contracts can interact with the crptocoins and tokens I mentioned earlier. A smart contract can also keep track of data, kind of like an Excel sheet on the blockchain, that is fully transparent and open. It's trustless, like I said, because you can view the code before interacting with it, to ensure that it truly will do what its creator claims it should.\n\nBecause smart contracts have the capabilities I mentioned above, they can be used to validate the authenticity of certain assets. As I mentioned above, those gaming cards would be created by a smart contract, and since the smart contract only does exactly what it's told to do, people can verify that the card is real, by checking if its original creator was the smart contract that runs the game.\n\nOn top of that, smart contracts can be used for more than just games. They can be used for voting, open and publicly ran insurances, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), liquidity and swapping protocols, lending protocols, etc.\n\nAll those get even more technical. A decentralized autonomous organization, is exactly what it sounds like. A company that doesn't have a CEO, or anyone running its operations. Everything that happens in that company is executed via code. If the smart contract is supposed to change, to e.g. support new features or use-cases, then people would first have to vote on it. The voting systems are always different as well, but a popular example is MakerDAO, which created its own token that people can hold to get voting rights. So essentially anyone can make business decisions by holding the token. This is a popular approach in crypto governance in general.\n\nLiquidity, swapping and lending protocols have to do with DeFi. DeFi stands for decentralized finance, and is a whole new world of taking over the tasks from traditional banks, and putting them on the blockchain. Instead of earning interest through the middleman, who takes a cut, you add your liquidity to a liquidity pool on the blockchain, and make far higher returns. This can even be done with stablecoins, which are essentially coins or tokens pegged to a fiat currency value, so you don't have to worry about the volatility of crypto.\n\nSwapping protocols allow people to trade between currencies without a middleman as well. Instead of a centralized exchange buying millions of crypto so that they have the liquidity when you want to buy it, a DEX (decentralized exchange) will use smart contracts to have the community pool this liquidity, and anyone that adds liquidity, just like with the above mentioned lending protocols, makes a good amount of fees for the risk and effort. I must add that the risk is usually extremely low with well-established DEXes.\n\nI could go on about crypto all day. But the last two things I want to mention, is that crypto really could help some third-world countries, but even first-world countries in a meaningful way. The Cardano developers have been partnering with African nations to introduce better ways in tracking education data, voting turnouts, etc. using blockchain. These systems will be somewhat closed, as they probably will be ran by the government, but they will be leveraging the same blockchain technology we see here in the public system.\n\nOn top of that, there are blockchain projects working on early implementations of UBI. If we can ensure that everyone only signs up to said blockchain once, then we can pay out a certain basic income rate which is something some first-world countries direly need in this time of automation.\n\n**Touching on the Metaverse.**\n\nI just want to make a quick note on the Metaverse, as recently it has been a controversial topic with Facebook's rebranding and the parabolic price action of related cryptocurrencies. I think it's interesting, and again, just like traditional games are able to put certain value on items, the Metaverse wants to build a decentralized digital world. So whether you like it or not is up to you, but it's kind of like playing VRChat on steroids. Along with the financial incentives, people are just going to do what they can to get in early. So maybe it's something for you!\n\n**Wrapping up.**\n\nI will admit, blockchain tech, and crypto, still has a long ways to go as of right now. There are some great projects out there building on some awesome ideas, but it's worth nothing that Ethereum still runs on PoW, which uses a fair bit of energy. Luckily, most modern blockchains use PoS, which doesn't, and Ethereum 2.0 will be migrating to it. There are other concerns, such as interoperability, and centralization, that will need to be addressed by projects, to bring crypto into the mainstream. But I think it's worth keeping this technology on your radar, as it might just have the same effect that the internet did to bring knowledge, media and many more opportunities to a wider mass.\n\nThat's all for my explanation on cryptocurrencies. I've written a previous thread going over some of the [myths about blockchain technology and crypto](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueUnpopularOpinion\/comments\/qs6v2b\/crypto_isnt_just_a_trading_game_or_a_gamble_and\/), if you guys are interested. My approach has always been to try and educate people. I don't want to change your minds, if everything I wrote here still has you convinced that crypto isn't for you, that's okay. But I hope everyone makes an informed decision, instead of following influencers and politicians, since they always have a stake, that will go against most of us here.","52":"This post is definitely inspired by a recent argument on Reddit. But as a software engineer with an interest in crypto and where it's headed, I'm just incredibly bothered by the misinformation being spread by people that seem to just be throwing a tantrum that they couldn't invest into BTC when it wasn't worth anything. Then there's also people who like to talk about shit that they don't know jack about. It really is the embodiment of the \"I don't know shit about fuck,\" meme combined with some \"If those kids could read they would be very angry.\"\n\nTo address some of the points made by people against crypto.\n\n***\"Oh but crypto just puts power and control into a different hand, instead of the government.\"***\n\nYes, **you**. Literally you control crypto, its value and the fluctuations, market circulation by using it. Crypto is entirely open. You can go read the code that you run on your own computer to join the blockchain network to make sure that no foul code has been added to break the system. Literally thousands of people do so on a daily basis which is what makes it so secure.\n\nGovernments have no safeguards or checks to ensure that they actually operate in our interests. [Inflation during the pandemic was five percent because governments care more about short-term economic revival than long-term sustainability.](https:\/\/www.rochester.edu\/newscenter\/what-is-inflation-is-there-economic-crisis-485642\/)\n\nBlockchains for larger cryptocurrencies such as the Bitcoin network run on millions of machines already. For a hacker to steal or add money they would need to affect at least 50% of every node in this setup. With traditional banks and currencies we're giving institutions and governments a ton of say in our own holdings and essentially providing them with ownership unless you're holding a physical asset like gold or an estate.\n\n***\"Crypto will make it easier for rich people to get even richer, and conduct shady business.\"***\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, cryptocurrencies run on blockchains that are held by millions of people on the world. Joining the network is easy, and you can take a look at the ledger of BTC, SOL, XMR, ETH, etc. easily to see what the movements look like.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic a lot of millionaires and billionaires made their riches by transferring their assets to safer investments knowing that the economy would be hit hard during this time. In a world running on crypto it would be impossible to hide such large movements, and one could even create bots to use this transparency to monitor the global financial market in a way that evens the playing field for people that aren't connected to those circles.\n\nNot to mention, while crypto can be anonymous, most of them aren't and it isn't hidden behind any locked doors. It's incredibly easy to find out who the owner of most crypto-wallets are. There are only a few exceptions of privacy oriented wallets such as XMR but those have a different use-case that is by far less shady than what we currently have with financial institutions such as banks and investment firms.\n\n***\"Crypto is a scam! I've seen countless breaches and ponzi schemes.\"***\n\nScams exist right now, too. All it takes is a shitty website disguised as a bank or online retailer to get your account information and steal thousands of dollars. This happens pretty much every minute to thousands of people across the globe. Crypto is no different. In fact, I'd argue that people who take crypto seriously, inform themselves before getting into it also get better at IT security and protecting their passwords, accounts, and files, due to the slightly steeper learning curve for getting into crypto compared to other assets and its technical nature.\n\n***\"Crypto will enable the rich to get richer and further increase the wealth gap.\"***\n\nThe rich are already way ahead of us. But crypto doesn't make this worse, and if anything this sounds like an argument to invest IMHO. I'm not saying anyone should buy crypto, that's not the point of this post at all. But it's just not an issue that crypto is creating or making worse, even. It's a different asset to invest in, and thanks to its transparency at least we can monitor large wallets to understand what the wealthy people are doing if we're so convinced that they know something we don't. With traditional assets you have no idea whatsoever about what's going on and who is preparing for the next doomsday.\n\n***\"Crypto is bad for the environment, and takes away clean energy that could be used elsewhere.\"***\n\nThis would have been true at the start of the crypto and in particular, Bitcoin, mining phase. People were spending insane amounts of money on mining farms, GPUs, wasting energy and such, but things have changed.\n\nFirst of all, [Bitcoin mining, while still a thing, is running on nearly 60% green energy, a number that's only increasing.](https:\/\/www.livemint.com\/market\/cryptocurrency\/use-of-green-energy-in-bitcoin-mining-jumped-to-56-in-june-quarter-report-11625212165534.html) That makes it one of the main industries that primarily relies on clean power sources and is on a trajectory of becoming carbon neutral, while many other applications that waste a lot more power are still stuck on coal and nuclear energy. Not only that, Bitcoin mining actually gets most of its energy from excess produced in countries such as Iceland which means no one is being denied renewable energy since no one actually seems to care to use it except miners.\n\nSecond point. Bitcoin mining is one of the few wasteful consensus strategies still being used at a larger scale. Other, more modern currencies, such as SOL, XMR, ETH, DOT, etc. use proof of stake mechanisms to validate transactions, which can be ran with very little energy and actually still are profitable for retail investors. Bitcoin mining is only profitable if you run ASICS in a large server farm and have cheap energy and infrastructure fees.\n\nThere are cryptos that still run on proof of work validation mechanisms, or even some more exotic file-based ones that ruin hard drives. But as someone that invests into crypto with the future in mind, I doubt that people will be taking those seriously for the long-term when they're already released with a disadvantage to their core systems.\n\n***\"Crypto is only used for investing and trading, it will never be a real currency.\"***\n\nThat's literally your fault, though. If you buy crypto just to hodl it for a year and leave, then you're part of the problem. There's evidence that wallets made within the previous 90 days will quickly sell when the crypto market starts dipping. Any wallets that exist longer than that seem to hold on to their assets for ages because they genuinely believe in crypto being the next big thing.\n\nI know of far more people that see crypto as a currency they want to use in the future as a proper replacement for fiat. Stores online already offer incentives for using BTC, Tesla even accepts it as a payment method, while Twitter is adding it for their rewards scheme. Even Reddit now has a token on the Ethereum network to handle their premium memberships and community rewards. Check out the Reddit vault if you haven't yet. For mobile users it's in the side menu below your settings and profile menu options. The underlying blockchain technology used by crypto can be used for even more decentralized apps, such as content sharing networks, Solana already has dapps designed for artists, while DAAG is working on their decentralized stock exchange network on Solana as well, and the potential is nearly limitless.\n\nSo yeah, as I said. I don't want anyone to use this post as an incentive to buy crypto. I'm not saying you should. But please, inform yourself if you are going to criticize it, and use valid point. Crypto is a polarizing topic, so a lot of misinformation is spread on a daily basis and headlines are designed to infuriate some while exciting others. That's just how the news works. But crypto has a technical nature, which makes it easy to examine with an objective point of view. Make use of that and start making informed decisions about your finances instead of getting angry at the system and not doing anything about it. This is your chance to be independent from some of the biggest and most unethical institutions out there.","53":"[deleted]","54":"Everyone hates China. I get it.

A thousand billion (2.5-illion) is 1M^2.5 .\n\nThis means the Spanish system has a more parsimonious naming rule and is a better representation of the numbers it describes.

So you:\n\n1: Want to arm more criminals per capita (since laws only apply to law-abiding citizens, and gun legislation to disarm criminals is inherently an oxymoron)\n\n2: Want officers less capable of handling firearm situations in real time (with or without more gun legislation), since less funding = less officer capability and quantity.\n\n3: Let\u2019s say scenario 1 doesn\u2019t happen for the sake of argument, and we get all guns from the citizenry, legal or illegal: Want to take guns from regular people, so that police have even more leverage in real-time scenarios? When supposedly ACAB? That\u2019s entirely backwards logic.\n\nI see no way these scenarios play out well. It seems (at least to me) that people\u2019s real issue is with how the police budget is spent, and the discipline of bad apples.","110":"[removed]","111":"I just saw an article about how the FDNY has had to temporarily close 26 firehouses over a staffing shortage after the vaccine mandate resulted in a wave of dismissals.

This is horseshit.\n\nTo be clear, I personally have received both doses and think it's a good idea to do so. And while I think it should be a personal choice whenever possible, I do concede that there are some professions where a mandate is appropriate. But firefighting isn't one of them.\n\nIf there's a fire emergency, I dont see why anyone would even think about the vaccination status of the fire crew responding. The important thing is that there are enough on call to actually respond in the first place.

The better approaches are to either have a respectful back-and-forth conversation with them while not disdaining any answers they give to why they think or react the way they do, no matter how off-the-wall or disgraceful, or suggest they see a cognitive psychologist about the matter.\n\nFurthermore, seeing such people as \"not worth the trouble\" actually perpetuates the very problem so many people disdain. Thus, throwing such people under the bus can (ironically) cost society high quality talent. Their deficits don't negate their actual in-born talents in other areas, even if bad experiences inhibit development of those talents. This is especially true if they already show at least job-quality competence or praiseworthiness in certain areas society values highly (economic, cultural, humanitarian).\n\nIn summary, disdaining and especially refusing to help (i.e. so-called \"coddling the person\") is like somebody slamming a sledgehammer into a stalled-out car's engine because that person's irritated that the car won't run, even though expensive but still worthwhile repairs might make the car driveable.","122":"There are so many more pressing pressing issues than other people coming into the country, yet a huge portion of right wingers seem hyperfixated on it and when you question them on why they give the same weak reasons.\n\n\"Different values\" okay?

I'm not saying the CEO is a saint, but I think overall the good that he did by creating and leading Amazon overweighs the negatives.\n\nSome positives:\n\n* Pioneered cloud computing almost a decade before any of the other tech giants (Google, Microsoft)... Which has allowed other companies (Reddit) to grow and scale to where they are today.\n* Reduced the total carbon foot print of the US. It\u2019s a lot cheaper for a neighborhood to order online rather than each person drive a 2-ton vehicle across the earth every-time they need to buy a carton of milk. It's cheaper for Reddit to rely on AWS than build their own data-centers. Amazon is also on track to run entirely on clean energy by 2025.\n* Has given people a lot of their time back that they would\u2019ve had to spend running errands like grocery shopping. That extra 3-4 hours saved every week and reinvested wisely can compound into something life changing for a lot of people.\n* Has employed over 1.5 million people with a company-wide minimum wage of $18\/hr and good health benefits. Amazon\u2019s net profits in 2020 was around 21 billion dollars. They pay their employees 90 billion dollars in wages and other benefits.\n* Yeah Amazon\u2019s CEO has 180bn net worth. But by founding and spearheading Amazon, he also created \\~1.6 trillion dollars worth of wealth for other people (Amazon\u2019s total market cap is at 1.8 trillion dollars). A large portion of that wealth are in pension funds, 401Ks, and Universities.\n\nYes the guy didn't do everything by himself. But the thing is is that he was the one who created the company, invested the most into the company. And was there at the beginning when every action, decision and dollar invested was the most impactful.\n\nThe workers who were there at the beginning or *anyone on the planet* also had the option to become shareholders of the company as well. For every $10,000 that they had invested it would've been worth $2-3 billion today.\n\nIf they had chosen to do that, who did they exploit exactly?\n\nYou can extend this argument to all of the companies whose products that you use or rely on everyday... Apple, Microsoft, Google, Netflix etc... The founders are or were all billionaires. But their companies have helped provide value to people more than they have harmed people.\n\nThe average US citizen still enjoys a lifestyle that is far better than the majority of people on the planet today.\n\nWhen China adopted the same capitalist system that we use, thousands of people became billionaires.

It doesnt really make sense to me why we care about progressive vs regressive. Your income rarely determines how much you pay in other areas of life. I dont hear about people splitting rent with roommates based on income, or splitting a dinner bill based on income. Mcdonalds doesnt look at my w2 before deciding how much to charge for my burger. So why do we thing government services should be charged based on income?

A bio mom that puts the new born into the foster care system shouldn't be allowed to take the kid back. The kid should quickly be given to a family that want the kid for life. It's not good for kids to keep switching environments. We should do what's best for the kid, and I don't think the mom\/dad getting the kid back is good for them. Yet everyone says that because of biology that these bio parents should have legal claim to the kid. \n\nPeople also say preventing people from having kids, whether through social pressure or other means is a bad thing. I don't feel sorry confining a serial killer in prison alone where he cannot reproduce. Similarly, I wouldn't see a problem if we had laws or policies that prevent unfit parents from having kids. For example, one child policy, or taxing people for every kid they have over the second. \n\nIf we argue people should be able to decide our own life, I would agree. But the mentality isn't consistent. If people want the government to layoff how many kids we can have, then they should layoff on how kids are raised? It's either it's moral to let the government control your kids life, ie mandatory education (yes even homeschooled kids need to show they are progress) or the government is immoral for control. \n\nAlso, lets say in a futuristic world we have a pill that makes you infertile. No side effect, nothing. The only way to go back to being fertile is an antidote that the government gives you an antidote so you can have kids. The unpopular opinion is people think it's creepy for the government to control your sex life. It's no different than sex work being regulated, and also I just don't see how it's creepy to prevent the harm that a child may face. \n\nI also don't see why it's so 'wrong' to say poor people shouldn't have kids. I'm broke, I'm not gonna have kids. It's as simple as that. If I were 16 and unable to raise a child, I should not consciously and knowingly have sex to have a kid just because I 'want' one. I know people say a lot of kids in poverty are because of lack of education and contraception. If you are so dumb you don't know that having sex could lead to a child, then I can agree. But if you know that, then it's on you that your kid is suffering, and you disgust me. Lack of contraception isn't an excuse from adults. \n\nHonestly, my biggest issue, and I've tried on changing my view subs and stuff, but I just fail to see why raising a kid is a right. People want kids isn't a good reason for it to be a 'right'. And people want makeup and jewelry and whatever. A kid isn't something that should be seen as 'I want, therefore I should get'.

Can you not see this feeling might apply to others such as smokers, obese people etc? Obesity is high in USA. Private healthcare (insurance) could theoretically have people paying different rates. If you got hospitalized once for lung failure because you smoke for example, your cost goes up.\n\nIf you had any diseases that was linked to lifestyle, it goes up. Or at least, I think if the doctor prescribes you something, exercise once a week at least (show proof, such as video) your rates stay the same. \n\nI'm just saying, for me it's a necessary sacrifice, but doesn't mean I have to be happy paying for people's poor choices.

Just because the country started that way, doesn't mean it has to continue. \n\n'Canada' started with a lot of warfare etc, doesn't mean we should use that as a way to decide how to get shit done. \n\nThese are the most common arguments, but not limited to.","166":"The Republic is a hypothetical nation where sovereignty rests with the *people* and not corrupted representatives, monarchs, and other rulers who are in it for power.\n\nAlso, the inhabitants do not let tyrants run their lives and take away their freedoms and fight for their freedom to say and do whatever they want. \n\n\nIn the Republic, the government is a true democracy and not a bunch of lobbying politicians people who do not care about the people.\n\nThis kind of government will never exist in this world and there is so much rhetoric about how much a nation is free under the title republic.\n\nIn truth, it's easier said than done many leaders are corrupted and people are oppressed by every government institution within the very nations that claim to be the Republic.","167":"[removed]","168":"Let me be clear -- I understand the various reasons people feel they *need* guns, and also (in the US) why it became a right granted to the people via amendment centuries ago, as obviously it was top of mind for the founders of our nation.\n\nI cannot understand the concept of *wanting* to own a gun. A gun's sole purpose is to kill. (Or, you could say injure, but essentially kill). That is its purpose. At the very least, it is used for destruction. The reason I struggle with understanding \"gun enthusiasts\" is because essentially, you're collecting\/obsessing over a tool used to kill others. Though you hopefully will not have to kill anyone with it yourself, that is what it does.\n\nI look at it as some twisted eventuality of us being granted the right to have them (in other words, of course at some point, having access to them, this was bound to happen), but at the end of the day, the idea that someone is so gung-ho about owning something with such a purpose is what feels off. This may be more of an American perspective, as I don't think the love for guns is so prevalent in most other nations, but is has obviously shaped our culture greatly.","169":"Not only is she intelligent and well-spoken, she turns a lot of loaded questions right back on the trolls asking them. The amount of times I\u2019ve seen her absolutely dunk on a Fake News talking head is ridiculous and I can\u2019t get enough of it. I wish more people would stop treating those trolls as if they were doing their jobs in good faith. \n\nI think what also makes her look better is her being appointed on the heels of several of the worst press secretaries in recent memory. Trump\u2019s many secretaries never really bothered to get informed on the actions of the White House and would instead make stuff up on the spot and attack the journalists. It was very uncomfortable watching obvious propaganda mouthpieces act childish and then smile as if they weren\u2019t human garbage. \n\nLet\u2019s hope this starts a trend of putting competent people with a quick wit in positions where they can shut down Fake News.","170":"What the title says. I don't get why people don't workout. You don't have to be a body builder or some sport competitor, but exercise is essential in living a fulfilling and long life. \n\nEvery person I've came across who does not have some form of daily exercise are really toxic people and have so much anger. Idc if you are fat or injured. If you are pursuing this basic form of self betterment as best as you can, you set yourself apart from people who just sit on the couch all day. \n\nI use to really hate fat people, but it was misguided. I don't hate them, especially if they are trying to better themselves. I just severely dislike and don't trust anyone that can't do something basic as at least trying to move for an extended amount of time. \n\nThere is no excuse besides illness. Dont have enough time? Manage your time better to allow 30 minutes for yourself. You can hold off on watching YouTube or Netflix. Don't want to break into your relaxing time? Knock out a few push-ups during loading screens or in-between episodes. Just try.","171":"You know, I get it. Women have a right to choose what to do with their own bodies. But men also have this right. As a man, I don't want to put my body in possible danger to save a woman who is being assaulted, if the woman isn't a friend or family.\n\nIt's fascinating to see how so many feminists on this website are shaming men for doing nothing to help a stranger.","172":"[removed]","173":"The way I see it is, if you are in my castle or my body and I don't want you there. Out you go.\n\nI have no idea what the person breaking in wants, not my problem. I'd like a quick way to get him out. In Canada, as I know, even warning shots are illegal. \n\nWith my body, especially if it'd against my consent, its not my problem, even if I was pro life. It doesn't matter if you put a magically shrunken Einstein in there. It was there without my consent, not my problem. If an action occurred and reversing it would let someone die, I still think it should be legal. Same way if I reverse my decision to donate blood. \n\nThe unpopular part is that oddly, people who support making abortion legal aren't s big fan of guns. And vice versa. I'm not sure why but here it is","174":"Okay here me out, pineapple and peanut butter are good together on top pizza. As are olives and garlic and pickles. Those two different combinations, as well as others not listed, are great on pizza and make for some of the best pizzas I\u2019ve ever had. They really bring out different flavors and combine in good ways.","175":"[removed]","176":"[removed]","177":"Yes, even with something as dramatic as COVID did not make 'society' disappear. I find people who see any change as a drama that will 'collapse' society hard to understand. I think the whole 'get mad because someone said something racist' are stupid, but they are not 'collapsing' our society. If we suddenly had a dictator, 'society' would still exist. Not the society you like, but society nonetheless. It's funny how people are like 'soy boy feminists will kill America' or others say 'evangelicals will bring USA down to its knees with it's extremism' or 'social media is killing us'. \n\nIn the great depression, society was shit, but still existed. I think it will take a lot more to kill societies.","178":"Every time he says the word \u201cBrother\u201d I want to rip my ears off. Haha brother haha stay hungry hahaha stfu. I know that\u2019s like his thing but it\u2019s just so weird and annoying. Another reason why I say this is because there are too many opinions like \u201chere is why women are evil\u201d or \u201chere is why you should be gay\u201d or something and I wanted to shake things up a bit. Anyways yeah lol","179":"","180":"Ever wonder why your opinion is considered truly unpopular? it\u2019s because it\u2019s a shitty, mean, gross, and objectively wrong opinion. \n\nYou aren\u2019t some genius free thinker who isn\u2019t afraid to state the truth, are an asshole who is wrong. You\u2019re not a revolutionary thinker, you just lack common sense and common decency. \n\nYes, it IS unpopular, but it\u2019s because you\u2019re being an asshole, and you are objectively wrong. It\u2019s like me posting \u201cAntarctica is actually very warm.\u201d Your opinion isn\u2019t unpopular because the majority is blind, it\u2019s unpopular because it\u2019s wrong and you\u2019re an idiot who lacks basic logic and critical thinking. \n\nHalf the posts on here are some alt-right take on why people are too soft or some bullshit like that, which makes sense because most people on this site know that you are wrong.","181":"If someone treats the people weaker than themselves like shit it shows that they're a bully and it a poor reflection of their moral character. Let's look at how Joe Biden treats the people weaker than him \n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/yrh6ExrmIoY\n\nIn this video a reporter asks Joe Biden a question, Joe responds by calling this guy a \"damn liar\", he calls him fat, tells him that he's \"too old to vote, and basically humiliates him in front of everyone. What kind of person is Joe Biden? There are also videos of him sniffing and touching children inappropriately(which were unfortunately taken off of YouTube). \n\nNow let's look at Trump\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/ASOTct1woo8\n\nA female reporter was picked for an interview the reported said \"thank you Mr president\" and Donald Trump responded with \"you're not thinking you never do\" embarrassing the woman in front of everyone. \n\nThis woman is not a billionaire, politician or a celebrity. She is not on the same level as Trump, this behavior was uncalled for and rude.\n\nWhat kind of wretched scumbags are these people? Did their parents teach them any manners? Did their fathers ever spank them?","182":"[deleted]","183":"[removed]","184":"I really don't understand why so many people find street preachers so infuriating.\n\nYou're not entitled to peace and quiet in a public area, and if you're not interested you can just walk by and get on with your day.\n\nThere's other people such as charity canvassers and salesmen that use similar tactics to reach out to the public but nobody seems to have with them.\n\nI suspect that some of it's motivated by anti-Christian bigotry.","185":"I love to make \u201ccereal\u201d out of random foods\/snacks, which to some is a crime. I  personally love to just drown some snacks\/food in milk and eat it like cereal. It\u2019s even better when it\u2019s a super crunchy food and it gets super soggy and milk absorbed. It\u2019s just so tasty and enjoyable to me because of the texture the food gets throughout eating it. My favorite foods to do this too are crunchy ones since it goes from super crunchy to super soggy as it\u2019s absorbed the milk. \n\nI write about this as it\u2019s always seen as weird or just disgusting because it not defined as cereal. To me, it doesn\u2019t matter all that matters is that you enjoy it and find it tasty or just pleasing. Just because you don\u2019t like it doesn\u2019t mean other people should t be allowed to like what they like.\n\nSome of my favorites to do this with are baked chips( bbq is the best), chicken flavored soup mix, certain pretzels, rice cakes, popcorn, crackers, cheezits, crispy cheese hot pockets, pizza crusts(and cheese pizza since meat isn\u2019t the best soaked), gold fish, waffles\/pancakes, hot fries, (O)reos, EL Fudge, donuts and pretty much any crunchy snack I can fit in a bowl usually is a pretty good choice too.","186":"If you have a *need or desire* to watch \"straight\" porn instead of solo sexy\/naked women to get and stay sexually aroused, you are not heterosexual.\n\nDuring a heterosexual act, your focus is the woman, and the vast majority of time you don't even see your own penis, you see (and touch) her - a woman.\n\nWhen you watch \"straight\" porn you have 50\/50 man and woman stimuli. And see a penis 100% of time.\n\nIf you were truly heterosexual, seeing a man would make you *less* aroused.\n\nI've also heard the argument that people watch it to \"imagine they are the guy\" but that makes no sense. There is no situation in which you need to see another person for your imagination to work. If you imagine you're skiing or skating or driving or washing dishes or whatever you don't need to see\/imagine another guy doing it. Or see your hands\/legs doing it.","187":"[removed]","188":"Seriously when did this kind of behavior become okay?

Suicide isn't a competition. \n\nThere is a time and a place to discuss something like this but under these kinds of videos, posts, etc. is not one of them. \n\nAnd to the person who is going to say \"Well, feminists do this all the time to men and no one says anything\", no one should be doing this...ever!","189":"Colin Powell is the reason you can't have 3oz of water on an airplane. Colin Powell must now take responsibility for not having more than 6 socially distanced people at a gathering.\n\nI believe in the law of reciprocity.

The best we can do as a society is to honor his legacy in kind.","190":"[removed]","191":"Its weird how feminists are correlated to anti free speech people. Its also funny that the people who call themselves for free speech are against people with sexual freedom. \n\nI support both. Sticks and stones and all. Just because you can't get laid doesn't mean you start pressuring people to fuck you. \n\nThe unpopular opinion is both people will be mad when i say its a good thing people can fuck whoever they want and as many as they want with consent of course. I just don't see this as a societal problem. People say things like 'men\/women, you shouldnt sleep around, I'm begging you to stay monogamous'. The question is why? There's no incentive for either. If men want sex but the woman they are with don't wanna, its his choice to leave. Most men I know don't want commitment. That's fine. Its their choice. I just don't see a reason or way to incentivize them to stay, and I don't care. \nThe second part is you should be allowed to say a lot of things without getting arrested, and people should grow thicker skin.","192":"Look if you hate someone so much that you have have to ban them online for holding a different opinion, it is you with the problem.\n\nLike why do you take your time to harass a stranger?

Men and women are no different in this aspect. But for some reason, I've seen men think they have some moral high ground over women's ideas of an attractive man. If a woman states that she wants a tall partner, she must be a shallow bitch and a terrible person.\n\nSo what if some women want a tall man. The same way weight is an indication of attraction for men, height is an indication of attraction for many women. Yet I\u2019ve had heard men call women shallow bitchs and argue with them about wanting a tall guy and then turn around and claim that they don\u2019t date fat women? Their argument was always that being fat shows your lifestyle and lack of restraint. As if that somehow made them more righteous.\n\nNow I know what you're going to say \"It's unfair, a woman can lose weight, short men can't just grow some inches!\" No it's not unfair, both are physical standards. Do you honestly think attraction is determined by which traits can be changed?\n\nAnd even if I were to agree, what do you want women to do? As far as I know, women can't simply change who they're attracted to. Should some women just pair up with men they don't feel attracted to, so things are fair?\n\nShort men what do you expect women to do?","194":"[removed]","195":"so, i just got done watching bill maher\\`s rant about stan lee and, i know i\\`m going to sound ridiculous for saying this, but i\\`m offended. i am utterly offended.\n\ni used to be a huge bill maher fan. i loved religulous and i loved his stand up. however, as a nerd, what maher said in his rant hit a little close to home with me because i am a nerd myself. i love comic books and i love to read and analyze them. i betcha that maher has never picked up a comic book in his life because if he had, he would be able to see the amount of effort and creativity that goes into a comic book. and he can just fuck right off with that bit about how comic books can\\`t be deep. seriously. there are many examples of deep comic books. watchmen, the sandman, kingdom come, etc. it\\`s perfectly fine for him to not care for the medium but that doesn\\`t give him the right to disparage people who do and to say that they should die(his words, not mine. \"i\\`m not happy stan lee is dead. i\\`m sad you\\`re alive\"). not only that he got super defensive in regards to kevin smith, his followers, and marvel(rightfully) calling him out for his disrespectful attitude. bill maher may not have disrespected stan lee but he did disrespect HIS ENTIRE BODY OF WORK. i know this sounds stupid but i can\\`t help but feel that maher was personally attacking me just because i don\\`t fight his idea of what an adult should be. yes i like comics and anime but i don\\`t let it interfere with living my life. i act my age, i work a job, i go out with friends. i am a perfectly normal person who just so happens to like comics. but according to maher, i\\`m a immature child and i deserve to die. i don\\`t know what was worse. the fact that he was looking for validation for his asshole attitude...or that he was FUCKING GETTING IT! if you watch the clip, the audience is rolling in the isle and even applauding at times. APPLAUDING!!!! shit like that just reminds me of how many assholes exist in the world.\n\nnot gonna lie. after i watched the clip, i got quite teary eyed. i rarely get my feelings hurt nowadays but that got me right in the heart. this has shown me who bill maher truly is. he is not a hilarious comedian and social commentator. he is a bully. plain and fucking simple. he is a bully. if someone doesn\\`t conform to his idea of a person, then he rips those people to shreds. he uses tragedies as an excuse to promote his own agendas. he is an asshole. quite frankly, i\\`m surprised that his show didn\\`t get cancelled after he wished DEATH on comic book fans. if i were the head of HBO, i would have forced him to apologize, after which i would have ended his show and removed all traces of it from HBO.\n\nbill maher, congratulations. you just lost a fan. i hope your little rant was worth it. may you never breed sir. god forbid your children become nerds.\n\nEDIT: ok, so it\\`s the day after i posted this and i\\`ve calmed down significantly. i am still kinda mad but my emotions were fresh when i posted this. you guys did make some very good points about how me wanting to cancel just because he has a different opinion then me is wrong. i do admit that what i said was wrong and it actually goes against my own principals.\n\ni am still angry and offended by maher and i do intend to never support him again but i no longer want to cancel him. instead, i\\`m just going to live my life the way I want to. i\\`m going to continue to read comics and just be geeky because that\\`s who i truly am at heart. and i don\\`t give a shit if bill maher doesn\\`t like me. i have lots of people in my life who DO like me for who i am.\n\nthey say the best revenge is a life well lived. well, i intend to live my life and i will live it well.","196":"My problem with these movements is not that I believe people should be mean with fat people. A person with respect will not do that.\n\nThe problem for me is that it is just focused on 1 characteristic.\n\nWhy not call it characteristic shaming? Why not apply it to age, bald men, short men, small penis, etc.?\n\nIf you make fun of a girl being fat you get crucified, however you can make small dick jokes all you want and shame guys for having a small danger, and no one will care.\n\nWhy the double Standards? That is what I do not agree. They act like fat women suffer more than x. But who are you to say that?\n\nIf you are going to apply to one group of people, why not apply the concept to all groups?\n\nThe moral should be: you should not shame people for their physical appearance. Not \"you should not shame exlusively fat women\". We should apply the concept, NOT the example.\n\nIt reminds of a South park episode, where Cartman got AIDS because it was the cool disease. But then it stopped being and cancer became the new cool disease and he lost all attention.\n\nWe should focus on the concept not on the example.\n\nIf you think shaming fat people is wrong, then you should apply to any other characteristics, and not just follow the new twitter #hashtag, to whatever one is trending.","197":"People are comparing their experience as a single person with no work experience to what their parents took decades to provide for them. Its entitlement. Yeah no shit you cant afford to buy a 4 bedroom 2k sq ft house in the suburbs that you grew up in being a single adult right out of college. Your parents couldnt have afforded that either. But they saved money, gained more skills and work experience so they could increase their income, built a stable marriage etc. Young people are naively expecting to be able to jump into the exact same living conditions as their parents that are 20-30 yrs older.","198":"Every time Disney has an LGBT character or YouTube bans a racist person, Conservatives lose their shit.

They\u2019re huge, multinational conglomerates - the kind that the entire left side is based on dismantling.\n\nI feel like Conservatives want to feel like they\u2019re somehow the victim, despite having basically controlled US politics since the start. I figure this is because they realize they\u2019re the side of racism and hate (their last leader was literally endorsed by the KKK), but that\u2019s just my best guess.\n\nMaybe some of you guys can
