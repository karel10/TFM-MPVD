Yes, of course. Culturally German? Very much possible. **Ethnically** German? No, ethnically can’t be chosen, if you’re born a specific ethnicity you can’t change it.

Liberals say this is racist but i don’t see how that’s the case, i am **not** in **any way** saying a person should be treated a certain way based on their ethnicity, but to pretend that ethnicity is entirely cultural and that ancestry has no role in defining it just isn’t true.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776D933C18>
1,vn82rq,Assuming someones gender or ethnicity based on their opinion is dumb and hypocritical,donotholdyourbreath,1656480822.0,4,0.7,7,"Unless you are willing to do that for every opinion and every group, you should not do it.

For one you act like one ethnicity and all the genders are some homogenous group. That frankly is just gross. For example, suppose I said I was against gun restrictions and you said ""oh look another alpha man"" this is bad for all genders. It assumes that men are this homogeny of gun loving. It also assumes none men, usually women are this homogeny of anti gun.

Plus mentioning peoples gender is not a counter to any argument. 

if its not OK to assume someone is black because they made, say an opinion you don't like, you shouldnt do it assuming someone is white either. Suppose I said ""you have a dumb opinion, you must be black"" that of course is not OK. Neither is it OK to say ""I assume you are white because of your opinion I disagree with"" this assumes only white people can be in the group you disagree with. 

Further more, this is hurtful to people who are not white. It assumes the groups that are not white are not diverse at all. 

And if people will say ""but statistically people who support trump identify as white"" then I can say, statistically people who do x are black.

Furthermore, he does a great job of covering controversial subjects by stating facts that people don’t want to hear, but still need to know in order to understand an issue.

3,vn2jmj,"It's time for federal abortion legislation, but not the kind that people are calling for.",YourEyesAreBleeding,1656463512.0,0,0.5,28,"The left is calling for federal laws that enshrine the right to get elective abortions, while some people on the right are calling for federal laws that restrict abortion or outlaw it in all cases.

Here are my thoughts on the type of federal abortion legislation we need: Enshrine the right to get an abortion if the pregnancy is the result of a rape, incest, or the fetus has a serious deformity, or if the life/health of the mother is in danger if she delivers the baby -- but simultaneously outlaw any abortions that happen after viability.

Viability is the point where if the baby was extracted from the womb prematurely, it would still live and likely have a normal life. Once the baby reaches that point, it is a human, and aborting it is murder, plain and simple. Before viability is more of a grey area, so this legislation would allow the states to come up with their own laws, and the local populations could decide what type of restrictions they are going to have on abortions -- however, these states wouldn't be allowed to completely outlaw abortion in the case of a rape, incest, etc. as I listed above.

I think this is a fair compromise, it gives states a lot of freedom to decide how they want abortion laws to be, which ultimately gives power back to the local population. This legislation also restricts the morally reprehensible parts of both sides though, such as killing babies after viability, or forcing women who were raped to deliver the baby.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776DDCBE80>

I feel like a sex-ed teacher half the time to younger men. People villainize the industry on reddit and youtube saying how lonely most of the men are, but many of the lonely men learn through escorts, chaturbate streamers, female twitch streamers, and onlyfans girls about females and romance. People come to me for advice all the time about why they are unattractive, how to have sex, or how to get a girlfriend. In a way, I almost see it as a snowboarding instructor or another skilled instructor. Just because the activity is fun does not mean we should be demonized.

Here’s what isn’t communist:

- taxes

- universal healthcare & education

- universal basic income

- separation of church and state

- democrats (including Sanders and AOC)

- Europe

- liberals

- handouts to the unemployed/lazy

- environmental regulations

- the anti-work movement

- gun regulation

- totalitarianism

While certain communist philosophies do include a few of these, the mere presence of them does not make the concept or the society communist.


One particularly egregious one is UBI.

8,vmg26k,I think abortion debates being framed as pro choice and pro life isnt the best word choice,WaterDemonPhoenix,1656396490.0,3,0.6,20,"At the end of the day, its about whether abortion should be legal or illegal, at what point. That's it. Nothing else matters. because I notice a lot of people say they are pro life and that gets people to bring up stuff like foster care. If they don't want people to bring that up, they should not call themselves pro life. As someone who used to call myself pro life, I believe even if I wanted abortion illegal I wouldn't say it anymore because some people do not deserve life. I have no problem with capital punishment.

On the flip, though I support abortion being legal I find being pro choice of course isn't a good thing for everyone either. Some people might support a woman's right to choose an abortion, but not a criminals right to freedom to choose where to live (of course) 

In my opinion 'pro choicers' also make dumb arguments. I also heard of people argue that criminals get their freedom removed because of violating the social contract. Then if abortion is illegal, no problem arresting people who try to get an abortion right?.

I know you say they are unrelated. That's the point though. saying pro choice or pro life distracts from the main topic.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776DDC2710>
9,vmet37,Progressives need to actually run for office and take real world action instead of spending all their time complaining on social media,NoooNotTheLettuce,1656391938.0,0,0.38,13,"So many people are convinced they are doing something by tweeting about, or flooding Reddit, with their political beliefs. You are not changing anything by promoting progressive ideals on social media. Straight up. In fact, I'd argue many people are harming the movement by spending all their time and energy on social media. Don't we realize that capitalist America would much rather have us online than in the streets protesting or putting progressive ideals into action by running for office? It's easy for politicians to ignore the angry Twitter mob, but it's a lot harder for them to ignore protesters outside their house or another political candidate challenging their beliefs.

I'm convinced nobody has ever changed their political beliefs based off a tweet, or a reddit argument. I loathe the term, but when Reddit is flooded with political commentary without any action it just feels like disingenuous ""virtue signaling"".

r/antiwork is one of the biggest subreddits but what really is the point other than to complain? Believe me, I appreciate the sentiment but that sub is not going to reform anything. Sure, you could say it's ""raising awareness"" but what good has that actually caused? We saw what happened when that mod went on Fox News. He literally got laughed off the broadcast and completely dismissed.

Progressives wonder why conservatives seem to be running the country despite the majority of the population being left leaning and it's because they'd rather talk down to republicans and repeat the same talking points than actually practice what they preach.

We need to realize that sharing your strong political beliefs on Reddit isn't any different than telling them to your dog. You aren't changing a damn thing and if you do want to make a change, log off and go put in the real effort. Until then, nothing in this country will change.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776DDC7828>

i’ve always thought this, even as a 12 yr old girl. i don’t think people realize how terrifying the thought of hosting another being in your body, constantly growing and stretching out your body to an unimaginably huge size and feeding off of you, then having to shit it out your vagina. it’s like a parasite.

sometimes it hurts to shit… my shit is nowhere near the size of a newborn yet i’m supposed to squeeze that through my vagina? that sounds like someone just thought of the most fucked up torture method they could think of and that was what they got.

imagine being a young girl or woman and hearing that there are people out there who *want* this to happen to you. sadistic freaks that are so angry at you for being a slut that they salivate at the thought of forcing you through one of the biggest fears we had as a child as a ‘consequence’. it sends shivers down my spine.

Now, I do think it's bad that people lost access to abortions and that that was a negative thing that happened. BUT:

Per [a recent article](https://www.insider.com/gen-z-reconsiders-sex-wake-of-possible-post-roe-world-2022-6), Gen-Zers have stated that this ruling will ""deter [them] from casual sex"". 

Because we know [from studies](https://royalsociety.org/news/2015/01/men-are-less-promiscuous-when-women-are-scarce/) that more choice in sex partners leads to promiscuity, it follows that less choice leads to less promiscuity (or more monogamy/abstinence). I believe this will overall lead to more stable relationships. Either that, or we will simply become more abstinent overall. But I'm banking on the former.

Before someone calls me a ""sexist, controlling asshole"" again, know that I didn't vote for this ruling, and also am not even an advocate for it. Again, I said it's a negative thing.

Are we actually forcing women to stop having sex to avoid the risk of receiving a murder charge? What kind of fundamentalist logic is this? Abortions have always existed and will continue to exist until the end of time.

Choosing the life of a non-sentient clump of cells over that of a fully developed human woman tells me this country has only regressed. 

As a form of protest, as many women as possible should immediately refuse to engage in all hetero intercourse to intentionally cause the birthrate in this country to fall. Stop having children. A country that does not care about the livelihood of it’s female citizens should have no future!

If you care about the welfare of American society, you will realize this is a terrible decision. You cannot force someone to go through with pregnancy. That is THEIR body. And please don’t bother with the bullshit argument about personal responsibility. Women should be able to have as much sex as they want. Liberal attitudes towards sex is a defining feature of Western “freedom” and culture. And if that happens to cause pregnancy, they should be freely able to access abortion pills or a sterile D&C.

15,vm1gav,The argument that 'abortion isn't a constitutional right' is a flimsy justification for overturning Roe v Wade.,LordSaumya,1656352285.0,0,0.41,11,"The right to same-sex and interracial marriage, the right to use birth control, the right to travel, the right to vote without poll taxes, the right to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty, the right to procreate.

What do these rights have in common? None of these are explicitly mentioned in the US constitution, and have been established due to rulings of the Supreme Court. Yet, all of these rights are considered indispensable in any functioning democracy. Could you imagine states even being allowed to touch the right to procreate?

Hell, even the power of judicial review (the ability of the SC to declare a Legislative or Executive act in violation of the Constitution) is not in the text of the constitution; it was established in 1803 by the Supreme Court itself in the case of Marbury v. Madison (1803).

My point is that while there may or may not be other justifications for overturning Roe v Wade, the 'constitutional rights' argument is probably the worst one, since (a) the ninth amendment exists, and (b) if a right can be stripped based on the fact that it isn't in the constitution, it places all of the above rights in danger.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776DFDADA0>

It's simply letting the states decide their own abortion laws. It's especially hilarious seeing people in strong blue states freak out over this when they won't be effected at all. There is no doubt in my mind that states in California and New York will keep abortion legal for all cases up until 9 months. Heck they might even allow for post birth if they can. Just a wild guess here but probably about half the states will allow abortion on demand up until the day the baby is outside the womb. 

Some states will probably ban late term abortions and a few more 2nd trimester abortions. The only states that honestly might abandon all elective abortions will probably be Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas but even those states will still allow for the life of the mother. Even people in the states with strict abortion laws are still going to be able to drive on over to the next state. So there you go all the states will allow for abortions if the mother's life is at risk and most will allow 1st trimester abortions and quite a few states will have it on demand anytime for any reason. So really most of the people who are pro choice already live in areas that will allow it anyways and the people who want to get an abortion will be able to do it anyways since most states will at least allow 1st trimester which is when almost all abortions happen anyways.

26,vl166i,Mainstream organized religion is actually extremely similar to communism and in general is a form of collectivism. Any TRUE conservative should be an atheist.,barbarianaxe,1656236817.0,8,0.65,17,"Seriously though,how the hell do mainstream 'conservatives',who are *supposed* to be the rugged,every-man-for-himself individualists,justify their support of organized religion,ESPECIALLY Christianity,despite the fact that the whole concept of organized religion is inherently collectivist?

Not only this,but the New Testament appears to be a doctrine that shows a strong resentment towards the successful. As seen in the whole verse about a camel entering the eye of a needle being easier than a rich dude entering heaven for example. It reads almost like a person who never worked a day in their lives seeing some random rich guy walking down the street and then writing in their diary about how much they hate that they don't get enough welfare and  handouts and how that rich dude *must* be the evil one. It's so blatantly collectivistic and anti-individual that I find it hilarious how so-called 'rugged individualist' conservatives who claim to support unrestricted laissez-faire capitalism will proceed to talk about Jesus and recite cherry-picked verses.

It looks to me almost like a reversal of the worldview and systems prior to Christianity:organized religion turned things upside down by declaring the strong and successful 'evil' while declaring the weak and submissive 'good'. This is literally just modern socialism's disdain for people who are successful and live for themselves rather than giving out free stuff,but with a bit of mysticism mixed in. 

Look at the 'seven deadly sins':greed,pride,sloth,envy,wrath,lust,gluttony. To me personally,this looks like a way of guilt-tripping people for having an animalistic side because,after all,humans are still an animal. Why? Because all of these 'sins' are completely natural:not only that,but they are even *useful*. 

You can use greed as a motivation to succeed. Pride the same. Envy the same. Wrath you would use to take revenge on your enemies. Lust (for success) drives you to become the most ambitious you can be. Gluttony and sloth? This can just be interpreted as indulging in and enjoying the results of your success.

Religion is anti-nature,anti-individual and anti-logic. It is based on emotional manipulation and 'faith' in unproven concepts based on superstition. Any *true* conservative who genuinely believes in a society based on individualism first and foremost and has as his life motto 'DON'T TREAD ON ME' will reject religion altogether and base his beliefs purely on reason. Evangelical 'conservatives' are just totalitarian pseudocommunists attempting to control people and take away everyone's right to autonomy.


All authoritarianism is based on destroying people's autonomy through herd mentality and forced conformity:Religious zealots? ""Your property belongs to God,not you!"" Communists? ""Your property belongs to everyone,not just you!"" Fascism? ""Your property belongs to the nation,not you!"" . The first basis for establishing a state based on force and coercion like this is emotional manipulation. All conservatives who promote religion are merely socialists in disguise,refusing to acknowledge and denying that their religious book is one based on doctrines that sanctify and glorify submissiveness and weakness while demonizing ambition and success. Any conservative who has any level of actual self-respect and self-awareness should be an atheist if they genuinely believe in putting the individual above the collective as they like to claim they do.

* first, democrats and republicans should fork the constitution and propose changes to it as they see fit (e.g. the democrat constitution guarantees abortion and gay rights, the republican constitution more explicitly and expansively guarantees speech and gun laws).

* then, the residents of each state votes to choose which constitution they would like to adopt. the side with >50% of the votes wins for each state.

* each state becomes a state in one of the two new countries

* once the voting is done, all people will be given a two-year time period where they can move to a state which will be in the country of their choice, if they are not in it already. once the two-year period is up, they will become a citizen of the country where there state is in.

* we will have european style freedom of movement between the two new countries enshrined in the constitution of both countries. but one side can do border checks if they like (e.g. to prevent illegal immigration).

* we should also have a robust free trade agreement enshrined in the constitution of both countries.

* lastly, to start with, both countries will inherit the current statutes and common law, then each countries legislature can repeal or modify as they see fit.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776D98E5C0>

**IF** you are anti-abortion, or 'pro-life' then you believe it is the duty of someone who is pregnant to bring to term their baby. In other words, you believe that the baby's life takes precedence over the bodily autonomy of the pregnant individual. 

**THEN** you must also support a policy of mandatory organ donation in any case where it is viable. This would include people who are adamantly against having their own organs removed post-mortem, so long as they remain in tact afterwards, just as anti-abortion policy forces those who would prefer to have an abortion to bring their baby to term.

Organ donation is a life-saving medical procedure that takes organic material from one body, and gives it to another, who would not be able to keep living without it.

If protecting the fetus is relevant because it is seen to have some inherent value, that inherent value is not reduced because of how it came to be. It will still develop, in time, into a human being provided it doesn't miscarry like 10-15% of most pregnancies. 

However, if seen as a moral punishment of a woman for her misdeeds, this exception makes perfect sense. A woman who willingly had sex must be forced to carry a child to term as a method of control or punishment by society, unless it really isn't her fault that the sex occurred. This is much more consistent with the rape/incest exceptions. 

I'm willing to accept that this is about societal control over women rather than punishment, and I won't take that as a change in my view though I'm still interested in discussion.

37,vkj74o,Most right-wingers are deontologists. Most left-wingers are utilitarians.,LordSaumya,1656175944.0,1,0.57,17,"Through my interactions with both left- and right-wingers, I believe the majority of both camps can be broadly categorised into two separate theories of ethics: left-wingers are largely utilitarian, right-wingers are largely deontological.

What do I mean by utilitarian and deontological? Here are the basic definitions:

**Deontology:** right and wrong are determined by set absolute immutable moral 'laws' or rules. Actions which abide by these moral rules are regarded as more ethical than actions which break these moral rules.

**Utilitarianism:** right and wrong are determined by their consequences; it can basically be summed up as ""the greatest good for the greatest majority"". Basically, actions which increase net happiness and well-being are regarded as more ethical than actions which reduce net happiness and well-being.

Based on these definitions, I think it is fair to say that left-wingers are utilitarian, while right-wingers are deontological. Right-wingers are more likely to stick to certain rules like less taxes or the free market, even if circumventing those concepts could lead to greater net happiness. Left-wingers are more likely to evaluate the action by their consequence on the net well-being of people, even if these actions run directly against concepts like right to life. What does this mean in practice? I'll try to illustrate it using abortion rights as an example:

**Right-wing:** Moral rule: taking an innocent life is wrong. Life begins at conception. Ergo, abortions should be largely restricted.

**Left-wing:** People will get abortions regardless of restrictions. They should be able to get those in safe medical settings even if it kills the foetus. Reducing abortion restriction saves more lives, which increases net happiness. Ergo, abortions should be largely unrestricted.

People go into semantics about when a fetus qualifies as a human, but to me, the question is less about what it is now, than how it is developing &amp;amp; what it becomes.

If a fetus is developing normally, then for all intents and purposes, it will eventually become a human. Ergo, to abort before it can finish it’s development, is essentially murdering a human before they’re born.

**Every** multicellular organism is a “cluster of cells”. These dehumanization attempts and others, cause me to disagree with pro-choice arguments I come across.

——————

That being said, I do believe that abortion should stay legal. I would rather people just not have sex, or if they do to use proper protection, but I know better. I know they make stupid decisions out of sheer horniness.

I don’t think women should have to deal with the burden of 9 months of pregnancy, and even if it’s safer now, childbirth is still one of the worst pains a human can feel and they shouldn’t have to experience that.

Not to mention the monetary, time, and emotional investment of raising a child, they are a huge responsibility that not everyone is prepared for. 

And for some reason a lot of people don’t put their unwanted children up for adoption, leading to abusive/resentful parents and a shitty childhood for the kid.

——————

For  the record, despite what people say, I know the repeal of Roe vs Wade doesn’t make abortion illegal. Actually, I agree with the verdict; SCOTUS shouldn’t have the power to make federal law, that’s the job of Congress.

Even the other ""blue"" states don't think very highly of us.

53,vjn2q7,The Command and Conquer series taught me everything I ever needed to know about geopolitics and the game should be a required educational activity in schools,IanArcad,1656072918.0,3,0.66,6,"Unlike other Real Time Strategy games, Command and Conquer isn't set in some fantasy or sci-fi world where humans are at war with  orcs or elves or zombies or aliens, or where machines are fighting each other.  It is set in a world where western nations are fighting with utopian terrorists over the world's most valuable resources -- in other words, it is set in a world a lot like ours.  In fact I'd guess that there are people who played Command and Conquer in the 90s as teenagers and by the early 00s were driving tanks across oil Iraqi oil fields taking out [technicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_\(vehicle\)).

The strategic loop in Command and Conquer is as simple as it gets - you need resources to build military units, and you need military units to control resources.  Which means that when you see your opponents collecting resources, it's only a matter of time before there's going to be a bunch of tanks and troops headed your way.

And that's a great lesson, because in the real world, when countries build militarizes and invade resource-rich areas, like the US invading Iraq and Russia invading Ukraine, most of the debate is about how the war started, whether it was justified, what the goals are, etc.  Nobody really wants to admit that the point of having a large military isn't to just have it sit on the sidelines, its to acquire and defend resources, and yet the conflicts generally play out exactly that way, with troops being sent to poorly defended and resource-rich areas.

A related lesson is that when you give or cede resources to hostile actors, they're almost guaranteed to be used against you at some point.  Europe never countered Russian aggression in Crimea or Georgia and continued to buy energy from them, and yet was somehow surprised when they invaded the Ukraine. Likewise, after the Iranian revolution, people were surprised that the new regime immediately launched an attack on Iraq..  And just this year the Taliban have just been given control of a country and billions of dollars in weapons, and in about a year everyone will be surprised when they attack one of their neighbors or even our allies.  Instead of being surprised all the time, we should heed the lessons of C&C and be prepared.

Another important lesson from Command and Conquer is that you always need to be able to understand the conflict from the perspective of your opponent .  That's because if you want to stop a Hitler, Stalin, Bin Laden, or Putin, the very first thing you need to do is to think like them.  And there is absolutely nothing unpatriotic or wrong about having that discussion even though some people try to tell you differently.  (That you're supporting Putin or the terrorists or whatever by acknowledging that they have goals and motivations.)

In Command and Conquer it is also pretty easy to send a few flame tanks or engineers to blow up an opponents harvester or a grab a building or two and sell them, but ultimately you can't win the game that way, it just a delaying tactic at best.  Terrorism in the real world is very similar - it results in loss of life and makes headlines, but really doesn't change the power dynamic because ultimately it just consuming resources.  This explains why after the 9/11 attacks, terrorists shifted their focus from attacks in developed countries to attacks in weaker countries in which governments could be established, for example Syria, Yemen, and attacking the weak government in Iraq, and also why the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had little lasting impact.

Schools have been making headlines lately, and not in a good way - teaching kindergartners about gender identity or teenagers how privileged or oppressed they are.  Incorporating Command and Conquer into the curriculum would be a useful educational tool for understanding geopolitics and developing new strategies and tactics in the war on terror.  It would also motivate students to learn how to build the advanced technologies available in the game, such as the Ion cannon, tesla coil, mammoth tank, and the mobile construction vehicle.  Used properly, it could grab the attention of today's apathetic students and create a new generation of leaders ready and willing to defend civilization if it deserves to be defended, or else overthrow it if it becomes too corrupt and authoritarian, both noble goals  that seem to have been lost by the preceding generations..",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776F308E80>

Of course there is more nuance, but people shit on the anti socialists when they have legit concerns. and vice versa. But I believe everything has its pros and cons. 

If you live where there is universal health care, sure your health care is 'free' but the risk is you lose have lower income that is quickly accessible. In a more capitalistic health care system, the risk is if something bad happens the cost upfront would be higher.

In both cases, its a gamble. Do you risk losing some money now and maybe it is insurance for the future or do you keep your money now and maybe lose it in the future? The money could be kept as insurance..

Honestly, I'm just having trouble seeing why people shit on the other side so much when both are perfectly valid. I personally see putting my money towards insurance as better for me, but my government is a terrible fuck up in my opinion its hard to not not understand people who say government is wasteful and I'd rather keep my money",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776F3781D0>
56,vje5gb,Spain is better than Italy for Tourist,deathbypepe,1656039269.0,2,0.6,7,"The image of Italy consists of 2 things, old Roman architecture and idyllic green grass and vineyards.

&#x200B;

However the actual capitol of Rome isnt even in Italy, its in Turkey as well as all their architecture.

Dont tell me you want to visit the Colosseum, its rundown and im not even sure it is safe enough for them to let people in there.

The roads around it were designed for foot traffic hundreds of years ago, so they have to build cars the size of motorbikes to utilize them.

The only reason i would go to Italy is if i were a fashion nerd or into Supercar brands or otherwise respected Italian culture enough to eat pizza and pasta how they actually eat it(not the American BS).

&#x200B;

I will admit that Venice is still a respectable destination if you actually hop off the Cruiseship as well as the Roman Forum, i will not make much of a comment on the Vatican beside saying does anyone go to Buckigham Palace to see the Queen?

Like if you dont see the Pope, you cant go inside and all youre doing is praying then whats the point?

&#x200B;

Besides the grass providing the idyllic countryside feel, you also have similarities in traditional food as well as a great Michelin Star restaurant scene.

They also have more functional beaches, dont forget to visit Portugal which i still consider a part of Spain and arguably has better Architecture.

The Plaze de Espana and Bom Jesus do Monte are nice although i do admit the Architecture isnt as good as Italy, though how much you like empty plazas will be the determining factor of your affection for them.

Sheep are some of the hardiest Animals in the world, living in the rugged high country across the Northern Hemisphere, dodging all sorts of dangers, such as falling rocks, Snow Leopards, Birds of Prey, and many others. They are easily able to traverse steep, rugged, rocky slopes, and can easily jump across wide crevices. Lions could never survive the harsh environment that Sheep inhabit.

Thats boring as frick!

And second, the pedophilia, I have 3's,why,where and when?  It took until 2014, for child p**n to be banned on Japan, it took that long to be banned!  Why every anime High School has to be perverted as frick, lots of minors with big b***s, I know that they are fictional depictions but it's not just alright, could You imagine if live action japanese shows are like that, wow...

And lastly, the oversaturation, theres a lot of anime, a very lot, while people enjoy it, there's undeniably that the amount of anime is overexaggerated, and with the issue that anime is mostly the same, I think that there should be more creative anime actually, I mean Dragon Ball, Naruto, Pokémon, Digimon and Jojo's Bizarre Aventure are creative anime, Most of the time these animes don't rely on the cliches that I mentioned previously and they don't rely on sexualized minors to catch the attention of their audience(most of the time), with awesome battles scenes, interesting premises, and even Digimon having its own identity, I think that anime should be lesser saturated and have more creative and higher quality content in general.

Also the fanbase should be more criticized, they blame other fanbases for their fetishes and its completely normalized, I'm talking about the anime fanbase in general, it's very comparable with the furries and Nintendrones for their obsessions with memes, fanarts and complaining, Nintendrones like complaining and memes but in a serious level and furries like a lot of fanart, normal fanart and fanart with fetishes.

TL DR; Anime should be more creative, have lesser pedophilia even if it's just fictional and should have more quantity and than quality.  Also the fanbase should be more addressed and criticized, just like furries.

After   living through the 2016 and 2020 elections, there needs to be a major   overhaul of elections, especially presidential elections.

1. Electoral   College. There needs to be 101 electoral votes. How many electoral   votes does your state/territory get? That depends on the population.   Example: California has a population of 39.35m people and America has   329.5m people. California has 12% of the population, so they get 12   electoral votes. All states and territories add up to 101 so they're all   represented and there can be no ties. The amount each state gets is   based on the most recently complete census at the time.
2. Voter ID. You gotta prove you're an American citizen to vote in an American election. There is nothing racist about it.
3. Polls.   Polls need to close at 8, and there needs to be universal standards as   to when the cutoff is. I know in Philadelphia, if you're waiting in  line  when polls close, you still get to vote. That makes the votes in  that  are vulnerable to manipulation. It should be polls close 8PM with  or  without you. If you care about the election, you'll find a way to  get  there.
4. Mail-ins.   None of this crap with ""finding"" ballots 3 days after election day.   Only ballots that are received by the voting committee by election day   should count, and they must be signed and you must provide your license   information.
5. Long   lines. I hear all the time how in poor areas, there are long lines.   That's why there will be a 2 minute limit. You should know who you're   voting for anyway. After 2 minutes, the ballot machines will cut off and   whatever choices you've selected will be submitted
6. Ballot   machines. I know in some jurisdictions, elections are still run by   paper ballots. The universal norm should be machines in all states and   all counties. Russia can't hack these machines, that's an egregious lie.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776F5765F8>

Selfish is defined as a person or an act that benefits the decision-maker at the expense of other people.

However, nowadays, people are saying that any action that primarily benefits the decision-maker(s) is selfish. 

Sorry, but every decision that everyone makes can't benefit everyone all the time.

There are 7 billion people in the world, and 7 billion people want 7 billion different things. It would be impossible to please everybody.

Also, every living organism in the history (and prehistory) of living things is hardwired in their nature to make decisions that chiefly benefit the decision-maker.

Just becuase it benefits yourself at someone else's **inconvenience** does not make it selfish. It's when it benefits yourself at someone else's **expense.**

Example: Selfish is a greedy business owner who lays off employees so he could save enough for his vacation home. He made a decision that benefited himself (saving money) at the **expense** of other people (they lost their jobs).

Selfish is NOT taking the last pack of cosmic brownies at ShopRite. It benefitted yourself (you got the brownies) but it was at someone else's **inconvenience** (they simply didn't get the brownies).

I've also been hearing a lot of people use that word during the pandemic. I'm not selfish for wanting to go to a baseball game or going to see my friends or going out to a bar. 

However, YOU are selfish for wanting me to stay home and for all the businesses to shut down.

Both of these are inaccurate. The countries that Greece is actually most similar to are Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Albania, Romania, and Serbia, aka the rest of the Balkans. 

Greek food, music, folk culture, architecture, and religion are shared with the nations to their immediate north, and while you can find similarities to other Southern European or even to some Near Eastern nations, you can find the same in other Balkan nations also.

As Quentin Letts wrote ''Tattoos, once rebellious, are now so widespread it's more exciting to see someone who's skin is un-inked''. Not having a tattoo is the new having a tattoo. You think you're so unique by having a tattoo. In the UK 1 in 3 young adults has a tattoo. Yeah you're so unique just like everyone else. Having a tattoo is like wearing the same uniform everyday. So unique.

Tattoo parlors are littered with pre-drawn designs so what most people get doesn't even have an ounce of originality to begin with, permanently scaring yourself to stand out from the crowd by adding yourself to a large pool of people with identical tattoos to yourself. The irony of branding yourself like the rest of the cattle then claiming to be unique. Lets face it, tattoos are for stupid people.

As Theodore Dalrymple writes ''There are many things that I don't understand, for example why intelligent people would want a tattoo''. One of MTV's finest excrement's is a show called ""Just tattoo of us"". Hosted by Charlotte Crosby, a woman famous for having sex on tv and getting her vagina out at every available opportunity and Steven Bear, a man so devoid of intelligence that MRI scans would have trouble picking up brain wave activity. The premise of the show is that people get tattoos designed by their friends with no input of their own. This leads to some permanent passive aggressive tats. Such as one girl got slut tattooed on her 19 year old cousin because she slept with 4 of her boyfriend's friends. Again tattoos are for stupid people. A highlight of the show is when Charlotte Crosby gets a tattoo of a half bear/half cheetah on her back from Steven Bear as a reminder that she cheated on her ex boyfriend with him. She then proceeds to try to assault him.It's like watching prehistoric homo-genus discover tattoo guns instead of fire. Again tattoos are for stupid people.

With most relationships now lasting shorter than a goldfish's attention span, tattoo regret is now a growing problem. So many people regret getting shoddily done work that there is now an entire TV show dedicated to covering up bad tattoos. The tattoo industry constantly complains about this show because in many cases the awfully designed cover ups are even more embarrassing the the originals. Hiding bad tattoos with more bad tattoos. Again tattoos are for stupid people.

101,vf7xb4,"Every ""pro-choice"" argument falls apart under scrutiny, and it is NOT about ""women making choices about their own body.""",OddGuidance907,1655564165.0,135,0.7,316,"I have always been pro-choice on the basis that I feel it is wrong to force a woman to continue to be pregnant against her will, intuitively it just feels wrong. I still consider myself ""pro-choice"" even know. But when I am forced to reckon with abortion by actually analyzing pro-choice arguments and their implications, I find it increasingly difficult to defend them (except for cases of rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother) and now feel morally conflicted.

**The ""it is women making choices about their own body"" argument:**

A woman choosing to have an abortion is not just choosing something for her own body, but also for someone else's body: that of the fetus. Fetuses are not part of the women's body even before viability because they are a separate entity with a separate DNA profile, and are just as much a biological product of the father as the mother. 

A woman is technically choosing what to do with her own body, yes, in that she is choosing to no longer be pregnant if she does not want to be, but she is also choosing to end the life of another entity which is not part of her physical body. The fetus draws nutrients from the mother's body to develop and grow, but that doesn't make it part of her body. To argue that it is, is factually incorrect.

**The ""a fetus is a parasite and thus it is acceptable to kill it"" argument:**

A parasite is defined as an organism of one species that attaches itself to an organism of ***another species,*** with the intent of extracting resources for its own survival at the expense of the host. By definition, a fetus is not a parasite. The fetus did not ""attach itself"" to the mother, the fetus is present because the mother and the father engaged in sexual intercourse, for which the known outcome is pregnancy. To describe the fetus as a ""parasite"" akin to a tapeworm is to dehumanize it with the intent of justifying its death by implying it is less than human and an invasive species, and using this sort of language to describe humans of any stage of development is inhumane.

**The ""fetuses are less developed and therefore less valuable than their mother"" argument:**

This is probably the most persuasive pro-abortion argument, but it has deeply eugenicist undertones.  Note that I said above that a woman should be prioritized over her fetus if the pregnancy is going to kill her, but this is not based on me assigning more moral value to the woman over the fetus, it is that if the mother dies, the vast majority of the time so will the fetus, whereas the reverse is not true, so saving the mother saves one life, while trying to save the fetus is more likely to result in two deaths.

Any time we try to assess the worth and value of another person's life, of any stage of development, based on their characteristics or stage of development, we open the door to eugenics. If we try to imply a fetus is less worthy of life and thus can be killed because it is ""less developed"" or ""dependent on its mother"" then we no longer can clearly articulate why we cannot kill people who society deems as ""parasites"" or ""lesser than"": people who depend on machines for survival in the hospital, people who are disabled and do not provide any economic benefit to society and extract more resources from society than they contribute, the impoverished, people on welfare, people who are unintelligent, and so on. When you define the value of life in terms of development or ability to contribute to society, it has dangerous implications. There is a reason many people say they support abortion ""if the child will have Down syndrome"" or have a ""disability."" 

We do not have the right to decide which lives are more valuable than others and then suggest that those which are less valuable can be killed. 

**The ""banning abortion forces women to obtain illegal abortions/women have no choice/contraception is inaccessible"" argument:**

Nearly every single person on the face of this planet knows that having unprotected sex will result in pregnancy. I knew this when I was 10 years old. Even in schools where abstinence-only sex education is taught, people know that sex results in pregnancy. That a grown woman of sound mind would not know this is just something I refuse to believe. 

Yes, there are instances where birth control or contraception can be sabotaged by a controlling partner, or birth control can fail, and this is one of the reasons that I continue to acknowledge that there will always be exceptions in which abortion should be accessible, but the argument that banning abortion forces women to have unsafe abortions in the majority of instances is to imply that women generally have NO control over whether they become pregnant which is blatantly false. This isn't a moral dilemma but a falsehood. 

The argument that contraception is inaccessible is also false. Obtaining free or highly affordable condoms is not difficult. Birth control is usually covered by insurance. if a man and woman choose to not use these protective measures because ""condoms make sex less pleasurable"" or ""birth control throws off my body"" then you are making an active choice to risk a pregnancy occurring, and it is your fault if it does. Take responsibility for your outcomes. 

**The ""abortion is a women's rights issue/racial justice issue, men can just walk away from parenthood and removing abortion makes the situation inequitable for women"" argument:**

There are many reasons why this is just false.

1. Women can give their child up for adoption and are not forced to be a parent against their will. To state that removing abortion makes women forced to be mothers is just not true. 
2. Men cannot just legally walk away from parenthood if the woman chooses to give birth and raise the child. Men see their wages garnished, driver's licenses revoked or points put on their license akin to if they got into an at-fault accident, or can be sent to jail for refusing to pay child support. A woman can choose to absolve herself of all of this by having an abortion, but men do not have the same ability, so not only is a woman making a choice about someone else's body (the fetus) but the man's entire life trajectory. And before you say ""well maybe the man should not have stuck it in, he had his choice when he refused to have unprotected sex,"" so did the woman. Abortion doesn't give women equal rights, it gives them special privileges over at least two other people's lives.
3. Abortion clinics have been disproportionately placed in low-income areas inhabited primarily by people of color, especially Black people. Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, is on record stating that the goal of Planned Parenthood was to eliminate the Black population by reducing its birth rates. Abortion has led to far more Black deaths than police brutality, slavery, and genocides combined. Abortion is a wealthy white woman's issue, and has harmed the Black community irreparably, and is the reason why despite the Black population having higher number of children per household, the Black population has remained stagnant at roughly 12-13% for decades. Abortion is racist.

**The ""abortion enables women to have fulfilling sex lives on their own terms"" argument:** 

This will make me sound like a 70 year old Christian conservative, but I do not feel that a culture that encourages promiscuity, depravity, and decadence is a good thing. Going home with strangers you met at a club or bar every weekend and having unprotected sex creates public health risks, including sexually transmitted infections, mental health issues, and is dangerous. You never know who you are going home with and what that person is capable of, and while it is not your fault if you are murdered or raped, a dangerous situation could occur that could be prevented if we did not live in a culture of hedonism. 

Abortion enables people to believe that they can make risky choices with no consequences, because there is always a way out. There IS NOT always a way out of every dangerous situation that can occur if you hook up indiscriminately with strangers. 

The other part of this, is that the notion that women are all pro-choice and men are all pro-life is false. Most pro-life charities and organizations are run by women, and there are many, MANY instances where men try to force the woman into having an abortion she does not want to have because he does not want to be a father.

103,vem5oh,“Indexes” are inherently flawed systems of measurement and should not be used in discussion when comparing countries.,mattcojo,1655489070.0,1,0.52,60,"Freedom indexes are used pretty often when people try to dog the US

“The US is ranked 25th by freedom indexes” 

“The US ranks 21st in Education”

Stuff like that. But the point today isn’t to say “oh they’re wrong because the US is great”. My point is different. indexes are inherently flawed because they cannot account for different situations that exist in every country.

I got into a discussion recently with someone who tried to use these said indexes to compare the US to Norway: a country that frequently ends up at the tops of these lists, along with the other Scandinavian countries. Two of the arguments this user brought up were “government represents people better in Norway than the US” and “Norway currently doesn’t have the racial issues the US does”. And in said index, points got taken off for the US in such.

I won’t deny that Norway has fewer racial issues, and probably has government that represents its people better than the US, HOWEVER, it’s important to note that Norway is a country with not even 6 million people, and a 93% white population (83.2% of the population being native Norwegians), while the US has over 330 million people, and is far, far racially diverse in its racial makeup, and culturally.

So yeah, no shit Norway is going to have far fewer racial issues or better representation. Because they don’t have to represent nearly as broadly, nor do they have as nearly as size able racial minority population. 

A country like (but not limited to) the US will, not by any fault of its own, be taken points off for this. And that’s just scratching the surface. 

My point is that these indexes try their best to apply parameters to ALL countries like a monolith, something you simply cannot do fairly and justly.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776F5B6588>

1. ""Kyle is a murderer"" 

Let's establish something right off the bat. A statement of opinion is not defamatory, nor is a statement that's an evaluation of publicly available fact. So when people say ""Kyle is a murderer"", what are they saying? They're saying that what Kyle did that night in Kenosha fits the definition of murder. They can be referring to the legal definition or some other definition and it's still not defamatory. Just because he was found not guilty doesn't mean he's not a murderer and doesn't mean that you can't call him a murderer. Being found not guilty just means that the government failed to prove he committed the act beyond a reasonable doubt. That failure doesn't constrain anyone's free speech. That's why we can all call OJ Simpson a murderer despite his acquittal and why PETA can call all meat eaters murderers even though that's not the legal definition of murder.

2. ""Kyle is a white supremacist""

This is a statement about Kyle's state of mind, his thoughts and beliefs. It's impossible to prove what he thinks or believes, and so any statements about state of mind are really just opinions. People have different definitions of what a white supremacist is, and they have different beliefs about what they think Kyle thinks. It's not defamatory to use a different definition and to state your beliefs.

3. ""Kyle crossed state lines with a gun"" or other specific factual claims

This is the category of claims that might actually qualify as defamatory because they are actual factual statements. The problem is, Kyle is at least a limited purpose public figure. This means that for statements to be defamatory, they have to be made with actual malice, meaning they have to be statements known to be false or known with high probability to be false. So you'd need to prove anyone repeating this claim knew it was false at the time. That's hard to prove, especially since so many people were saying it. ""I heard this other outlet say it and I thought it was true"" would be a reasonable defense against a defamation suit.

Rittenhouse just wants fame and quick money. Fighting a lawsuit in court is expensive, so media orgs that know they'd win in court will still settle if they know it's still saving money overall.

111,vdnsdj,Snoop Dogg Should Run for President,bluepillarmy,1655391121.0,9,0.66,11,"  

I think that the famous rapper Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, better known as Snoop Dogg, should run as a Democrat for President of the United States. I am not joking. I think that if he did so, it would totally change the political landscape for the better. This is going to be a bit long but, if you stick with me for the next few paragraphs, I will explain why I believe this. 

**1.** **The Democrats have an education problem:**

Why don’t the Democrats dominate American politics? Why was the last election, which took place during the biggest pandemic in a century, so close? How the hell did the Democrats lose to Trump in 2016? Why do they [seem set to lose again](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/16/democrats-are-course-lose-2022-2024-if-they-do-we-may-lose-our-democracy/)? 

There are a bunch of theories, but I believe it is because the Democrats have become overly focused on college educated voters. I’m not the first one to point this out. This classic article appeared in [*Vox* in 2016](https://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11451378/smug-american-liberalism) and here’s one that came out in *The New York Times* [last month](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/opinion/democrats-david-shor-education-polarization.html) and another one from this month in [the same publication](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/04/opinion/democrats-culture-wars.html). If you don’t want to read all that, I can sum it up for you, the Democrats’ style and rhetoric is geared toward people who have at least a four-year degree. 

But here’s the problem[, most Americans do not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Map_of_states_percentage_of_population_with_Bachelor's_Degree_or_Higher_in_2009.svg). And this is increasingly creating a class divide in the country where two-thirds of voters feel like they are being talked down to and scolded by a party that wants their votes. This is an insane way to try to win elections and it needs to stop. 

I have news for Democrats, they can take the support of college educated voters for granted. As long as the Republicans continue their decent into increasingly insane ideologies such as, climate change denial, anti-vaxxing and even Qanon, you can be sure that the educated class will not vote Republican. So, the task at hand is to get the votes of people without college degrees. 

**2.** **Enter Snoop Dogg:**

Snoop would be the perfect vessel to usher in an era of progressive dominance in the United States. To start with nearly everyone knows who he is. The median age [for American voters in early 40s](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v64n2/v64n2p57.pdf), which means that the average voter was in high school when Dr. Dre released *The Chronic* and propelled Snoop to superstardom. He is an incredibly charismatic person, and he holds a lot of progressive ideals ([check out his Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg)). But, unlike the vast majority of Democratic politicians, he uses language that is accessible to non-college educated people. 

Obviously, he has a lot of baggage:  he has been arrested numerous times, he admits that was a literal pimp for some time, he has a history of chronic (pun intended) marijuana use and his early music is rife with misogyny, homophobia and glorification of violence. 

But…stick with me, I think that all of these minuses can be turned into pluses. To start with, it makes him very relatable. Far more people without college degrees have had run ins with the law than those with university education. Also, for those of us who remember the 90s, you know that misogynistic and homophobic language were somewhat common during that time. This does not make it right, but I think most of the people who lived through that era also can look back with shame at some of the things that we said. So, again, we can find a reflection of our human flaws and or eventual progress in Snoop. And that feels good. 

He'll probably have to stop smoking weed in order to run for president but, legalization of marijuana is a political winner. Most Americans have used marijuana and will not fault him for his past usage. He’ll absolutely need to earnestly apologize for the pimping. That’s pretty bad. 

**3.** **Snoop gets attacked from all sides**

Here comes the best part. If Snoop were to announce a presidential candidacy it would infuriate a lot of people and that is exactly what we need. To start with, a lot of super-smart people would decry the state of democracy and write super-smart editorials in super-smart publications like *The New Yorker* and *The Washington Post*, just as they did when Trump announced in 2015. And how do you think that is going to look to the non-college educated voters? How effective were such attacks on Trump’s candidacy?

Right, so we have them out of the way, who’s next? Likely the woke Twitterati will go after him for the aforementioned sexism and homophobia of his early work. Snoop can say, “look, I said a lot of bad stuff in the past, and I’m sorry, but we need to look forward and start getting this country back on the right track and not get stuck picking on people for what they said twenty or thirty years ago”. I’m sure he can come up with a much better way of saying that because he’s way cooler than I am but that is a very popular sentiment in this country and it’s what millions of people want to hear. It would drive Republicans nuts because their whole strategy is to portray the Dems as woke college kids who are out of touch with the average American. Even now they get scared when liberal media figures attack “cancel culture”. Why else would a leading conservative publication have been inspired [to write this](https://spectatorworld.com/topic/bill-maher-not-conservatives-side/)?

Finally, we have the racists to deal with. This is the easiest of all. The GOP is getting pretty good and racist dog whistling, but this would totally throw them off their game. So, let them hurl their hateful rhetoric at Snoop and see what happens. It will totally turn off black and Latinx voters, groups that [Trump actually picked up votes from in 2020](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54972389). Also, the Republican love to paint Dems and wimpy crybabies who are totally out of touch with “common people” and to be fair, the Dems kind of play the part, but just let them try that with Snoop…

**4.** **Snoop wins in a landslide**

Having withstood attacks from the chattering elites of media and Washington, from the “woke” snowflakes and from the alt-right Nazis, Snoop has more broad support than any politician since Roosevelt. I’m not making this up. This is what Americans want and this is what America needs. [Have a look at this study](https://hiddentribes.us/) which shows that most people are super turned off by activists on both the right and the left. Someone who has demonstrated a refusal to be cowed by those groups would be incredibly popular. 

Moreover, Snoop’s fame and charisma would likely bring out millions of poor voters and young voters who are historically difficult to turn out at the polls as they feel disaffected by politics and politicians. Snoop’s campaign would be incredibly empowering to the most marginalized groups in the United States. This is a campaign that would work. 

**5.** **The Dogg Administration:** 

OK, will probably have to start calling him Calvin Broadus but that was fun to write. 

I’m sure a lot of people are going to say, “Snoop Dogg is completely unqualified for the office of President of the United States”. To which I might ask, “And Donald Trump was?” To which someone may counter, “Donald Trump’s presidency was an utter disaster” and I would then say, “yes, but Donald Trump is insane, and Snoop is not.” 

I concede, he would need a lot of help and he would need to read up on the issues. But, that’s true for all presidents. There are plenty of people who would be more than happy to advise him on tax codes, national debt, foreign policy and the like. And I think he’s got the brains to make the right choices. 

Finally, we have one elephant in the room. Does Snoop want to do this? I think he could be persuaded. If anyone who has read this far knows him, please show it to him! 

Change my view, people! I’m worried that the Dems are about to get clobbered in 2022 and 2024 and I’m pretty convinced that this can work. I’m more than ready to entertain other ideas, however.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776F769860>

let's just change the binary classification to XX and XY

male female binary non binary sex vs gender fuck all of that.

XX and XY.

XX prison and XY prison

XX washroom and XY washroom

XX sports and XY sports 

this also solves the issue in which a female athlete was not allowed to participate because her testosterone levels were too high even though she was female assigned at birth.

let people identify as whoever, choose whatever.

sub-categorise on the basis of XX and XY.

chromosomes can't be called a social construct 

chromosomes can't be changed 

fixes the whole gender-sports debate because instead of being compared as men or women people are compared on the basis of physiology, hormones and  reproductive ability determining chromosomes. 

fixes the ID issue

your driver's license can say male and also have XX on it.

non subjective non fungible categorisation.

[For those who aren't aware, XX and XY are the chromosomes that determine your physiology/binary reproductive ability 

yes I know there are XXY and XYY combinations as well but those are insanely rare and can probably be adjusted for when it comes to things like washrooms, sports and prison.]

so you can say that you're a girl or boy or whatever and have that on your IDs and have your preferred pronouns but at the same time have an objective binary system to make stuff less complicated and avoid this discourse and the bs+transphobia that sometimes surrounds it.

your gender can be non binary because it is a societal construct

your chromosomes can't be non binary because science won't allow that.

we allow people to embrace the subjectivity of societal norms, gender and be fluid with it if they want to and also solve the issue of prisons, fighting sports, physiological differences etc.

trans women are women

trans men are men

men are men 

women are women

non binary people are non binary (in terms of gender)

fixed it for y'all now we can end this discourse/debate and the dumb bipartisan bullshit inspired by America™.

123,vcd15j,"Roe vs. Wade would be more difficult to overturn if ""Roe"" hadn't gone back and forth on her stance regarding abortion...",Cut-Unique,1655239204.0,6,0.65,15,"Before I say what I am about to say, I am 100% pro-choice. I support abortion, and the broader concept of bodily autonomy. I very much believe in ""my body, my choice."" So this is NOT a debate about abortion.

My issue is with the fact that [Norma McCorvey (aka Roe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_McCorvey) changed her stance on abortion on more than one occasion. After the ruling was passed, she ""found religion"" and became an anti-abortion activist, supporting politicians who were against abortion, and regretted her role in the decision to legalize abortion. She said that she was being used as a pawn for abortion activists. But then later, on her deathbed, she changed her stance again and said that her conversion to Christianity was financially motivated and that she had been paid to speak against abortion.

She went back and forth on a number of other things too, as you will see in the above link.

I feel that if she had remained a strong advocate for abortion throughout her life, she would be remembered as an activist who fought for women's rights. But instead she's known as ""Roe"", which is basically similar to ""Jane Doe"". People who are against abortion have plenty of things they could use as leverage. They could easily argue that Roe changing her stance on abortion and converting to Christianity is proof that she didn't really believe in abortion, and would have been happy if the ruling was overturned, or that she was mentally unstable and didn't know what she really wanted, since she kept changing her mind about various things.

So yes. Like I said earlier, I am pro-choice and do not want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned. But if it is, there needs to be a new advocate. A new voice who people would remember the same way we remember folks like Martin Luther King and Susan B. Anthony. I know there are things that people can use as leverage against them, but they are not John/Jane Does. Most people know who they are without having to look them up. That's not the case with Norma McCorvey; I hadn't heard of her until I researched the history of Roe vs. Wade.

The quote doesn't do the emphatic tone justice, but you get the idea. This post is almost a ChangeMyView piece. I have this opinion, but I could be swayed:

There seems to be a lot of talk about ""sexual compatibility"" in finding a decent mate. Do you know what completely screws that up? Menopause, around age 45-55, is inevitable. That's like 20-30 years of increased sexual rejection and related sexual frustration. So--unless most guys have a low libido--for a child free male, getting into a monogamous relationship is against their best sexual interest.

I realize sex isn't the be-all and end-all for a relationship. It's just a significant part. So for guys who do not have children and do not want children, getting into a strictly monogamous relationship will eventually screw them over.

This may not be an unpopular opinion, but I'm also of the belief that most people would cheat under the right circumstances and with a near impossibility of being found out. I have never wanted to nor been in such a circumstance, but I think it could happen to nearly anyone (besides perhaps certain Muslims or Roman Catholics who would risk death rather than do anything near cheating). 

Anyway, this belief supports my opinion that a monogamous relationship is bad because *if* either person does sleep with other people, it's more likely they'll keep it a secret. Non-monogamous relationships usually have that kind of stuff open and freely communicated.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776F936DD8>

I see plenty of posts by women in late 20s' and 30s' who constantly worry about finding a partner to have a child with. 

Of course, if they truly want that and it's an informed choice (based on more than societal expectations and fear of not being loved if they don't 'give' a man a child), then they should pursue what brings them happiness. 

Sadly, often women are pressured and 'rushed' into something they may not even want, because of these two main factors: 




1. Ingraining in women's brain from an early childhood that becoming a mother is just what they'll do one day.

In more detail: Gendered toys, especially baby dolls, glorification and misrepresentation of motherhood in media and fiction, language used towards girls/young women like 'when you're going to be a mother...' and more subtle clues that this is exactly women's destiny, without allowing them having an agency over this matter. Basically, taking from us an opportunity to think critically when it comes to childbearing.




2. Men valuing women's ability to reproduce above anything else that makes them a human being. Luckily, not all men.

In more detail. Women have been convinced that love between them and a man can happen only with an addition of a child, with the majority of men excluding any other option than biological fatherhood. For most, infertility seems to be a dealbreaker, and in some countries it's even a valid reason for a quick divorce or an annulation of a marriage. This is utterly sad because it tells us that women are not worth anything as humans and have no other value in the society.




My thoughts on this were around for a while, but I decided to post on reddit after hearing from one of the closest friend that he would break a long-term relationship with a woman he claims he loves, if it turned out she can't bear children, which means he prioritised hypothetical, non-existing beings over a person who thinks, loves and has emotions.


To sum up, this obsession around becoming a mother/father as a must, harms women who don't have partners yet and are afraid that their time is running out and they will never experience love if they miss their fertility years.

However, I'm not sure if most vegetarians know that there is an equivalent principle for human beings, called the non-aggression principle (or sometimes the harm principles).

In a nutshell, it says that the only ethical laws are laws that prevent people from harming or stealing from each other, because anything else constitutes aggression.  For example, the libertarian party has this in their platform:

> Criminal laws should be limited in their application to violations of the rights of others through force or fraud, or to deliberate actions that place others involuntarily at significant risk of harm. Therefore, we favor the repeal of all laws creating “crimes” without victims 

And while I am not a 100% libertarian myself, I do read libertarian publications like Reason, and one thing I've always seen that they do an excellent job of holding government accountable for the harm it causes, regardless of whom is in charge.  I think you also have to respect a political philosophy that basically wants to leave you alone and let you do what you want.  

Of course there is room for debate about how harm is defined, but as a principle it is difficult to argue with- libertarianism means less harm, less coercion, and less suffering.

gun control isn\`t about getting rid of guns completely. it\`s about regulations to make sure that gun ownership is handled responsibly. keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, children, and the violently mentally ill, three categories of people who should not be welding instruments of death. however, people seem to be interpreting this as the government wanting to take away guns completely. no one is saying that genius! we want regulations. rules keep order.

there are reasons that laws and rules exist. to keep order in society so that those who live in society can live the best lives they can without fear. that\`s why you need a license to own a gun and need to pass a background check. ironically, the people who are against this are the exact type of people who shouldn\`t have guns in the first place. 

""But tHe SecONd AmmENDmeNt!!!!"" dude, have you even read the constitution? because if you had, you would know that it reads and i quote ""a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed"". now, did you catch that first part? A WELL REGULATED! read that line as many times as you have to. A WELL REGULATED! as in, you can have guns as long as you follow regulations. only use them in self defense or while hunting as long as you have the proper permits and we won\`t have a problem. 

so you see, gun regulations will not infringe on you RigHTS. they will merely help to protect the people around you as well as yourself. if that\`s still unreasonable to you, then i don\`t know what to tell ya.

154,v824g0,Regularly scheduled television should only be interrupted for news coverage in the very worst case scenarios...,Cut-Unique,1654728353.0,3,0.67,5,"When people watch TV, they usually do so when they are tired after a long day and would like to escape from the stresses of everyday life. So it's a huge disappointment when you sit down to watch your favorite show that you recorded earlier in the day, only to see that the show was preempted for coverage of another mass murdering spree in a city that is on the complete opposite side of the country from where you live, or if they're holding some sort of hearing to discuss how to handle the latest stupid thing the President has done. There are just some people who can't be bothered with that shit; they don't want to hear about it because it's not affecting them in any way.

I can only think of a few scenarios where I think interrupting television programs for news coverage is absolutely necessary:

* If the country is under attack
* If there's any sort of big incident in the area where you live that you might actually be affected by
* If there's a natural disaster such as a tornado that you should be preparing for; and again, only if it's something that you and the people in your area would be affected by

The rest of the news coverage can wait until the regularly scheduled news program, or else broadcast on a separate channel with 24-hour news coverage. There are some people who want to be up to date on everything going on in the world even if they aren't being affected by it, but most folks really don't give a shit about that stuff, and ultimately they will find out about it at some point, just not right when it's happening.

I met different type of employers, luckily mainly reasonable ones, but one type always annoy me the most. Below, I'll give an example (this is UK if that matters).

I was interviewed for a low/medium position in a large, reputable institution. The job required a degree and experience in certain area and my interview went extraordinarily well. At some point I was confident I'll get the position. It was full time, 35 hrs per week, office-based role but considering the duties it could be easily done remotely and hours could be made flexible. I'll also add it was quite low paid.

I had no problem with any of it, but I asked if I could finish two hours earlier once a week for educational reasons, and simply make up those hours by adding additional 0.5 hour to the rest of the days. I have about 8 years of experience and in the majority of places no one would care for something that insignificant.

The employer suddenly changed the tone from super welcoming, respectful and happy to annoyed and somehow agitated. I sat in silence listening to the panel and learning e.g. that I clearly didn't even read the job description properly because it's a full time job and there is absolutely no room for any flexibility! 

At that point I knew there's no point trying to convince them/try for this job anymore but... they kept ranting! I finally left with WTF smile, thank them and left with relieve, knowing I won't see that place at least for the next few years.

That's just one of the examples. I genuinely feel that those kind of employers are so insecure that they want to show how much power they have over the others. 

I also feel they agree on 'reasonable' adjustments but only to what's specified by law like disability, chronic illness or having children/person in care. I believe education should be added to these.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776FDA5978>

166,v6ju90,Men should have a say when it comes to abortion!,Kerosycn,1654567633.0,36,0.69,82,"As a women myself I believe men do have a right to have opinions on, and have a say in abortion. Lots of girls, feminists and misandrists in media and online would probably think otherwise. Their arguments are usually that since they are men they can't talk about women's issues or that it's their body and their choice, ""My body, my choice."". But those arguments are pretty stupid and can be ripped apart. 

Firstly, ""men can't have a say in women's issues."" Most women issues are related to men doing something that harms women, as in something sexist. So if men stopped getting involved in women's issues, we would have practically no issues in the first place. This also makes no sense, because if issues are being caused by sexist men, and you don't want other men to get involved that won't help. Because those sexist men are more likely to listen to another guy instead of a women. If I hate all people with red hair, and red-haired people start advocating against it, and someone who isn't a redhead tries to talk me out of hating on redheads I would be more inclined to listen. Because A, they are someone like me, and B they aren't a redhead. So to deny non-sexist men a chance to talk in this is simple stupid. 

Another point I can make to this is, just because someone isn't apart of a community doesn't mean they can't have good opinions on it. 

And something that is also common is these girls bashing anyone who disagrees, by a lot. If you have an opinion remotely or even slighty different you're a ""bigot"", ""incel"" and ""women hater"". Even if you have good reason or don't force your opinion on others. 

Secondly, ""My body, my choice"". Everyone should have the ability to make their own choices in life but some choices just don't work out in good ways or have negative consequences. And yes, freedom of choice but not freedom of judgement or consequence. ""My body, my choice"" doesn't apply to all situations. For example, if I kill someone but I don't want to go to jail. Thats me as in my body, choosing not to go to jail. However you can't do that, and you wouldn't argue that I should have the right to do that, wouldn't you? If someone is slicing their wrist, mentally ill and gets dragged into a mental hospital, you wouldn't go and say, ""their body, their choice!"". (But I know some of yall weirdos prob would) 

Thirdly, why exactly should men have a say on abortion? Well all of my previous writing answers this question. But abortion also affects and involves men in someway. The man is part of the reason the baby exist, meaning the have a direct say in matters related to it. It takes two to tango, the women and the man. What if the man wants the baby and the girl doesn't? Should he just have so sit there and do nothing even though that's also his baby? I think abortion should be 50/50 meaning both parents get a say and work things out. 

I don't know how to solve the issue if the man wants it and the girl doesn't. But I believe the man has the right to discuss his view on it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776FFF8C50>

**""But if guns are taken away, people will just use knives or bombs instead.""**

I'd rather have bombings or stabbings, than shootings. 

Reasons for stabbings over shootings:

1.) I can outrun a person with a knife and keep my distance from them, but I can't outrun bullets. 

2.) Bullets can go through walls and kill people, but a knife can't. Even your own house can't protect you from bullets most of the time.

3.) Gunshot wounds are generally more deadly than stab wounds, because bullets hit with enough force to blow apart flesh, and they can also break apart inside the body, causing further damage.

4.) Guns can kill multiple people A LOT faster and easier than a knife.

5.) For law enforcement, dealing with a suspect that has a semi-automatic firearm, is far more difficult and dangerous for them than dealing with a knife wielder. 

6.) There are lots of stab-resistant clothing around, they're easier to make from scratch, and they're pretty effective. 

Reason for bombings:

1.) Most people either don't want to go through the trouble of creating and preparing a bomb, or they aren't smart enough to even make it in the first place. They are more difficult to use, and less easily accessible than a gun. This would probably explain why they aren't used as often as guns.

So yes, while killers will try to find many other ways to kill people, I'd rather deal with those, than deal with shootings.



**""But u/Heinrich64, criminals will still find ways to get guns no matter what, won't they?""**

The reason why they've been able to get guns in the first place, is due to stealing from guns stores & legal gun owners. No gun stores or legal gun owners = guns being far less likely to fall into the hands of criminals. 

And no, guns aren't smuggled into this country nearly as often as you may think. [Actually, it's quite the opposite.](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/02/stopping-toxic-flow-of-gun-traffic-from-u-s-to-mexico/) 

[The US is the reason why so many criminals in Latin American countries are getting their hands on powerful weapons.](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/05/23/guns-from-the-united-states-are-flooding-latin-america)

Also, many other countries have banned guns, and they don't have nearly as many shooting **MURDERS** as we do. And don't even think of mentioning their stabbing deaths, because we all know the death count would've been higher if the perps had guns, and my reasoning is explained in previous points. Stop comparing guns to knives. It's extremely dumb.



**""But what about my freedom?""**

If your freedom to play around with an overpowered weapon is more important than someone's life, then that means you're the kind of person that doesn't deserve a gun. If you're not willing to give up a weapon when you're legally required to do so, then that also means you're the kind of person that doesn't deserve a gun. 

It is of my opinion that those who are willing to give up their power for the sake of others, are the ones who truly deserve the freedom to wield it. I personally don't trust people who aren't willing to give up their power for the benefit of society, or when they are legally required to do so; you're basically admitting that you're a potential violent criminal. And don't even try to question whether or not the civilian populace would be better off without guns, 'cause you know damn well it would be, as lots of innocent people would still be alive today, if it was extremely hard, or impossible, to get them. 



**""But u/Heinrich64, how the fuck am I supposed to defend myself or my property?""**

There's pepper spray, tasers, self-defense knives, and even knife resistant clothing available. Hell, get a fucking axe, a machete, or even a fucking katana, and chop the bastard up, I don't care. If the perp doesn't have a gun, then you don't need one either. Just be prepared, be well equipped, know how to fight, and be good at running. You don't need to pretend like you're fucking Rambo. 

Also, there's security systems, cameras, and window gates to help protect your house. And if the perp doesn't have a gun, at least he can't shoot through your house.



**""But what if they have a gun?""**

Like I said before, they wouldn't even have guns in the first place, if they weren't made available to the public. That's where they get most, or possibly, all of their guns. No guns available to the public means no guns on the streets. The Uvalde Shooter purchased his guns legally as soon as he turned 18. If there were no gun stores or gun owners around to steal or buy from, how difficult do you think it would've been to get them? If he had went into that school with just a knife, how many more kids do you think would've survived? 



**""But what happens when the government tries to oppress us?""**

Ok, let's take a look at what's happening in Ukraine right now.  Ukraine has relied, **heavily**, upon Western military equipment to keep Russian forces at bay. And no, it isn't just guns,  they've also sent Javelin anti-tank missiles, Stinger anti-aircraft, and Switchblade drones. Now, imagine if Ukraine didn't receive any military equipment from any nation at all. They would've been SOL, and they had their own military equipment! This basically proves that guns alone is not enough to even put up a fight against our current military, if they really wanted to fuck us over. What the fuck are your measly little guns gonna do against tanks, armored cars, and jets? This isn't the 1800s anymore, where all the militaries had were single-shot rifles and some cannons. Nowadays, they have all sorts of shit they can use to take you out, if they wanted to.

And that's not all. You also have to account for the possibility of civilians fighting against you, in favor for the government! So basically, it doesn't matter if you have guns or not, you're fucked either way. And even if you somehow, by the grace of God, win this hypothetical civil war, you would still lose a shit ton of people, and the country will be in shambles afterwards. 



And lastly, I am not implying that guns are the only reason people keep being murdered here in the US. I'm well aware that our shitty culture and lack of support for the mentally ill are the other big things that lead to homicides. But don't sit up here and pretend like easy access to overpowered weapons hasn't played a part in anyone's death at all. You're just deluding yourself. I mean, for fucks sake, gunshots are common where I live. I don't feel safe in my own home, since a stray bullet can easily go through my house and kill my ass. Now, ask yourself, which would save me from being killed by a stray bullet: Having my own semi-automatic rifle, or the perp not having a gun in the first place?",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017770093518>

175,v5o32k,Legend of Vox Machina…kinda sucks,slpschoolta,1654467605.0,3,0.67,5,"Legend of Vox Machina is not that good

I like the animation and music but the humor and lack of proper character development drags the quality down 

There is way too much cursing, violence, and potty humor. It is very obviously trying to get across that’s it’s an adult show but it starts to get a bit grating after a while. Like at one point we see a character shit out a giant turd for no reason other than “lol gross do you get it’s an adult show now?” And there’s a lot of dramatic moments with characters dying but the tone gets ruined with a random f bomb or Scanlan singing about sex.

Also, I don’t know these characters. I went into the series with no experience with critical role so all I could see is that these characters are kinda bland. You take one look at them and you just know what tired trope will be their entire personality. Percy’s the  “you killed my father prepare to die” archetype. Vex is the hardass leader  with a heart of gold. Vax is the bad boy who acts tough but is soft on the inside. Keyleth is the “uwu I’m so powerful but I don’t know it cause I have low self esteem” girl. Pike is the healer. Grog is the dumb but lovable brute. Scanlon is the horny bard. 

All of these characters seem weak at moments but then all of a sudden they become hyper OP (looking at you Keyleth and  Pike) not because they’ve been training hard or have developed as people but because the plot called for it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017771140898>

184,v4pw9q,I am excited to see the increased queering of the hip-hop and rap communities.,SchmulyWormberg,1654352552.0,8,0.62,17,"For decades now, the mainstream hip-hop and rap communities have been havens of homophobia and hate against gay individuals. Rappers and artists in these genres for years have been allowed to get away with the most despicable and disgusting comments and lyrics directed towards gay people, all the while being praised and showered with awards, record deals and positive publicity, even from those who acted as though they cared about gay rights and against homophobia.

However, in recent years, we have been seeing a wave of new gay rappers who have taken the rap and hip-hop communities by storm... such as Lil Nas X and Tyler the Creator, amongst others. Yet, this new brand of gay-positive rappers has created significant anger among many of the still-largely homophobic community. In an interview, Lil Nas X says:

> ""The honest truth is, I don’t want to speak on a lot of the homophobia within rap because I feel like this is a very dangerous playing field... It’s more for my own safety rather than anything else"" [[source](https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/lil-nas-x-talks-homophobia-rap-safety-9613308/)].

...so, even despite his success, Lil Nas X still finds himself in danger from the entrenched homophobe mainstream of the rap world. Even from the progressive voices of America, only small amounts of condemnation is ever levied against this overwhelming anti-gay hate. Even the rapper Da Baby, who received some criticism for his recent homophobic remarks in 2021, continues to put out records and songs on major labels with significant positive attention and success.

As such, it is clear that a reckoning in the hip-hop and rap communities needs to occur to eliminate this entrenched homophobic majority within their ranks, so, I am very excited to see the increased queering of rap and hip-hop with new gay artists. If anything, I hope and very much advocate for a new army of gay rappers come to dominate the genre and push out the hate-filled homophobic rappers. I want to hear new songs from rappers about their gay experience, about their gay love, about promoting gayness in the hip-hop world, and making rap more queer. Furthermore, once they take over, I hope that all homophobic rappers and their songs are purged and eliminated, their record contracts canceled, their music removed from platforms, because this would seem to be the only way to cure homophobia within this community. I mean, come on, why are we still condoning homophobia from this group when it is not being tolerated in literally ANY OTHER domain? Anyone who still listens to homophobic rap and doesn't speak out against it is themselves either homophobic or are homophobia enablers.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x00000177710C4278>

Oh absolutely make no mistake about it

And even though I am a firm advocate of rugged individualism, though from a constitutional perspective, not from like an anarchist perspective, people do realize we been socially liberated from all social and moral responsibilities and obligations we used to have as a culture like ages ago, especially during the WW2 boom, this is where ""America first"" types come into play, even ironic enough our patriotism has waned off so much, it really makes you think


What did liberals and leftists think becoming a socially liberated society was going to do for the people real talk? You thought people were going to become more charitable, generous, welcoming anf that it was going to become this euphoric paradise? Quite the opposite, when you liberate people from their moral and societal constraints, people are naturally going to become more selfish, greedy, self-centered, more unconcerned with the greater of society, vain, perverted, power-hungry, materialistic and very shallow

Why would in a socially liberated society would people want to do what's greater for the community when there's no moral obligation to do so anymore? I want you to think this for a moment and see where I am going with this


So although I definitely prefer rugged individualism (not hyper individualism though, there's a big difference) over mindless tribalism anyday, the best of both worlds is really local communitarianism, which kinda promotes a culture of interdependence rather than codependeny or hyper isolationist individualism, which is also what I love about America having a decentralized government and why I fully advocate for states' rights.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017771240F60>

The trial was not about whether or not Heard also participated in abuse, shit in a bed or lied about donating money.  The central question was whether an Op-Ed that referred to Depp’s abuse without actually including his name represented malicious defamation.  In Depp’s own words he did abuse Heard so she can’t possibly defame him by referring to the same, and the fact that studios continued to sever ties with him as he was imploding his own career through dangerous and unprofessional behavior can hardly be said to be under her control.

For whatever reason the above recording was not included in the trial but ample evidence was provided with multiple witnesses corroborating that Depp was indeed physically abusive.  Instead dangerous victim blaming stereotypes were reinforced, she was grilled for not seeking medical attention, pressing criminal charges or flawlessly documenting every instance of his abuse with photos and videos.   Even though it is well documented that a large portion of abuse survivors do none of the above.

Heard was unsympathetic to a jury, most likely lied about or distorted some details  and participated in reactive abuse but none of that negates the fact that she was an abuse survivor as she stated in the Op-Ed.  Depp has become the face of DARVO, his courtroom behavior almost perfectly mirroring the demeanor of Brian Laundrie in his last recorded interaction with Gabby Petito before he would murder her.

208,v36l25,BTS betrayed the AAPI community by meeting with Biden,IanArcad,1654168879.0,0,0.48,44,"In May 2021, Biden had a photo op at the white house in which [he signed an anti-Asian hate crime into law](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/20/998599775/biden-to-sign-the-covid-19-hate-crimes-bill-as-anti-asian-american-attacks-rise).  Veep Harris was there and had this to say:

> ""Here's the truth: Racism exists in America. Xenophobia exists in America, antisemitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia — it all exists. And so the work to address injustice wherever it exists remains the work ahead,"" she said.

So did the administration put in the work?  Here's a headline nine months later.  [NBC:  Anti-Asian hate crimes increased 339 percent nationwide last year, report says](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-339-percent-nationwide-last-year-repo-rcna14282)

That's right, AAPI hate crimes __increased 4x in one year__ (according to this report).  And while you might think this is happening in ""MAGA country"" or whatever, the cities with the biggest rise in AAPI hate crimes are Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. 

As Asians are dealing with concerns about their own safety, they are also seeing academic opportunities closed off to them, and the people they counted on to defend their civil rights turning their back on them.  For example the incoming Biden administration [dropped its racial discrimination lawsuit against Yale](https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-drops-yale-lawsuit-9587f156426b3cd905be373e41bb12d7) based upon a complaint from the Asian American Coalition for Education coalition .

If AAPI hate crimes are up 4x in one year, especially in America's largest cities (that are also tourist destinations for Asian visitors), and the administration refuses to defend Asian Americans civil rights in education, why should [BTS give them a photo op](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/31/1102244756/k-pop-stars-bts-went-to-the-white-house-to-talk-about-anti-asian-hate-crimes)?  And the answer is that they shouldn't and it was a mistake to do so.

Of course BTS says that they were going to help speak out against Asian hate crime - but how does that work exactly?  Is someone who hates Asians going to listen to BTS and say ""yeah, actually guys you've convinced me""?  __If crime could be solved by pop groups flying around the world and doing photo ops then we wouldn't have any crime.__  Aren't the police supposed to protect people, or did we just give up on that?

I don't know what BTS was thinking here and my guess is that the whole thing was done as some favor to a Senator's or Cabinet Secretary's kid or something.  And what a lost opportunity for them to challenge the Biden administration on civil rights.  Really disappointing.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001776FA6A240>

2. obsession with body count. if you were an attractive young woman, i bet you would be sleeping around too. and don't give me that master key and lock bullshit.
3. i see often that dads suddenly have an epiphany when they start creating a real bond with their daughters, like they suddenly discover that women or girls have real feelings and aren't inanimate fuck toys. there was a really good askmen or askreddit thread about this and it was filled with comments like ""before my daughter was born i used to pump and dump women and cheat on them and treat them like shit, but then she was born and my entire outlook changed"" and they want a cookie for that or something? fucking stupid. now obviously that is a very slight exaggeration, but no shit there were about 2 or 3 comments that were nearly verbatim of what i just typed out. its like they had no concept of women being actual fleshed out humans but just sex objects and social achievements.

Let’s look at some more things, Lithuanian food is very close to East Slavic and Polish food, the Baltic and Slavic languages split from a recent common ancestor, Balts and Slavs are genetically closely related and look very similar, their histories are tied, Lithuania was the same country as Belarus and Poland for a long time, and later even with Ukraine and Russia during USSR times.


Additionally, Balts and Slavs have lived in literally the same territory for centuries, it’s easy to find Lithuanians in Podlaskie even today, and it’s also easy to find Polish/Belarusian people living in modern day Lithuania, yet if i were to look for a Lithuanian community in Norway or Sweden i doubt i’d find anything.

Overall, Lithuania and Latvia are very stereotypical eastern European countries that are distant from Scandinavia and are far more stereotypically Eastern European than a place like Bulgaria is for example, had the term Eastern Europe not had a negative connotation Balts would gladly identify as such.

But what I am referring to goes beyond that and seems more about trying to put down the U.S. and Americans than simply comparing.

It's a very childish kind of behavior that is all too common in international news. Many people in other countries cover unimportant US news to show how much better off they are, then they have the audacity to call Americans self-centered and ignorant.

The U.K. does this especially when it comes to things like health care and socio-economics. They cover a horror story in the US related to health insurance and than break to some comment about how blessed they are to have the NHS. Very transparent.

Australia and Canada do it too; In both countries there is a tremendous level of obsession over what and how the US does things. It usually turns into how they are ‘better’ than the US due to ""so and so factor"".

When I was in Australia many years ago, I saw a report covering Obama throwing the opening pitch for Major League Baseball in the U.S., and it was so odd. How is this news in Australia (baseball's not even a popular sport over there). They really can't blame the U.S./Americans for their own obsession. They would have never given Japan, Mexico, France, Brazil, China, Italy, Germany, Russia, ect; that ype of inconsequential and mundane coverage.

I’m not saying you can’t criticize the United States, but this type of fretting and comparing to boast ‘superiority’ just makes them look pathetic and full of themselves.

That is a big part of why I don't understand the criticism that Americans boast about their country being superior when it's largely a product of the international community's constant coverage of the US.

232,v0i6ht,It's wrong to blame the Uvalde police until we have more information,BlackScholesDeezNuts,1653851690.0,0,0.5,6,"My position is NOT that the police are blameless. My position is that in an evolving, chaotic, precarious situation with conflicting reports and a constant stream of unreliable information leading decision making, we shouldn't be blaming individuals for the deaths of kids until we know what led them to make the choices they did. In addition, there is rampant misinformation going around about the nature of the police response.

Here's what we know, [according to this timeline](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/05/26/uvalde-school-shooting-timeline/):

At 11:27, Ramos crashes his car into the school.

At 11:30, [according to this source,](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/us/uvalde-texas-elementary-school-shooting-friday/index.html) the first call to police is made.

At 11:31, [according to this source,](https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-shooting-texas-elementary-school-unfolded/story?id=84966910), an ISD officer who heard the reports immediately speeds to the school and tries to engage the shooter, accidentally confronting a teacher instead.

At 11:33, Ramos enters the school and begins shooting.

**At 11:35, two minutes later, three police enter the building to confront him and two are shot.** Four more arrive and **also** enter the building.

From 11:37 to 11:44, the shooter fires rounds in intervals.

At 11:51, the police sergeant and additional officers arrived.

**At 12:03, it is estimated as many as 19 local police officers may have been in the hall outside the classroom.**

At 12:10, the first federal agents arrive.

At 12:21, the shooter fires through the door and the police take positions further back in the hallway with federal agents.

At 12:50, the door to the classroom is opened using a key and the shooter is killed by a member of the Border Patrol.

There was never a time where Uvalde police completely left the building. There was never a time where they all retreated outside the school and waited for help from federal agents. I am not commenting whatsoever on how they treated parents, or the officers who went in to save their kids. I'm pointing out that numerous officers immediately engaged the shooter, multiple were shot, and they never abandoned the school. As time passes, only more officers enter the building.

Could they have been cowardly? Absolutely. But the commanding officer who assessed the situation as no longer an active shooter and now a barricaded subject almost certainly did not do so out of cowardice. The shooter shot volleys of bullets through the door at officers and was firing infrequently. I can't say it's impossible to believe there's scenarios that lead a commanding officer to likely and reasonably believe there's no longer students being shot in the classroom.

I certainly would not blame the individual Uvalde police officers, many of which charged in and were shot at and stayed regardless, who tried to burst through the door but couldn't while the shooter was firing through it. I will reserve that judgement until I know more details about the shooting, because the last thing I want to do is pile on with the rest of the internet to tell a bunch of first responders they're responsible for the death of kids when they risked their lives and were told to stand back on either bad commands or bad information. And I don't want to say the commanding officer was responsible when I have no idea what information he was using to make his judgement.

I think it's terrible that anyone is forced to confront a situation where an active shooter more heavily armed than themselves is made accountable for any and all of their actions before anybody knows what really happened. It is always easy to pin the blame for Chernobyl on technicians who failed to follow procedure on a routine and normally innocuous safety check for the plants' meltdown. It is always easy to blame the physician who accidentally overdosed a patient because he read the chart wrong after twenty years on the job. It is always easy to pin the blame on the grandmother who accidentally ran over her grandchild because she didn't check her rearview camera backing out of the garage for the child's death. What all these scenarios essentially miss is the systemic issues that come into play with these tragedies, that human error will always be part of the system and that confronting individuals who made a mistake in a crucial situation is a lazy way to convince oneself if not for this *bad* or *incompetent* individual, these things wouldn't happen. Maybe we need redundant systems in nuclear reactors to ensure that meltdowns are less likely when low probability events predictably align. Maybe we need automated dosage for patients so that a sleepy doctor doesn't result in a death. Maybe we should make new cars detect objects behind them and alert the driver like many do now.

Maybe, just maybe, we should reserve judgement on the action of officers in an active school shooting until we know more about it, and focus a bit more on the systems that lead to a situation where a botched police response means a dozen more children dead at the hands of a killer.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017771459D30>

Governments know it's easier to subject people to oppressive rule when they're defenseless. They use propaganda to pull at your heart strings and it works.

America was founded on being able to overthrow a tyrannical government. You can't do that without arms. You can sit there and say we can't win a way against tank and planes, but that bullshit. Look at the middle east.

The 2nd amendment was put into place to keep a tyrannical government at bay. It's not wonder they wanna get rid of it. The political elite do not give a fuck about you. At all. Not even a little bit. That's why they send your sons and daughters to fight their wars. That's why they pass laws and regulations to control women's bodies. That's why they cash huge checks payed put by the tax payer, but still don't employ affordable Healthcare or education. 

Neither Democrats or Republicans care about you. Disarming you makes you easier to control. They use propaganda to convince you that you're safer in someone else's arms. It's bullshit.

Another example that comes to mind is people refusing to call an ambulance even when grievously injured, rationing their insulin supplies against medical advice, and sometimes even crossing the border to avoid going bankrupt while obtaining basic medical services, because universal healthcare is ‘communist’.

Banning abortion because you’re pro-life but refusing to support a ban on guns while commiserating about yet another mass shooting in another school is peak hypocrisy. 

You’ll scream and cry when a competent adult woman does not want to play host to an unorganised clump of cells for 9 months which results in a life-changing, expensive and permanent responsibility they are unable or unwilling to take on. You won’t support increases to social security and minimum wage payments, nor free childcare or subsidies, not even government intervention for a formula shortage. You want babies born but not babies receiving quality care and support for a good quality of life. 

Scream and cry about adoption and foster care systems for unwanted babies, yet how many of you have actually adopted or been a foster carer for any of these children? How many of your own spawn did you pop out in lieu of supporting these unwanted babies? Why don’t you support increasing payments to parents who do adopt or care for children in the foster care system? They’re the ones picking up the slack for the rest of the self-righteous, self-interested extremists. 

Yet at the same time daily mass shootings occur all across the country? Children are dying in the middle of a school day for no justifiable reason. It’s simply widespread access to guns that enables mentally ill individuals to wander into a school and murder children. 

Why is the sanctity of life so important from the point of conception right up until the infant is born, but whatever happens after birth is none of your concern? Why are the rights of the woman less important than the development of this tiny parasite with no concept of existence and no capability to sustain its own life more valuable than that of the woman? 

Why is the general publics’ “right” to own and keep as many guns as they like, more important than the right of children to attend school each day without fear of being slaughtered? And if you’re fortunate enough to have never experienced the fear of wondering whether your own child was in fact one of the victims of another mass shooting, you are in a position of great privilege and great ignorance. 

Nothing in America matters to anyone unless they are personally and significantly affected by it, and if not then it’s someone else’s problem and I don’t care? No sense of irony. No sense of empathy for another persons experience or rights. No sense of personal responsibility. No attempt to understand the underlying issues that inform your ignorant, misguided beliefs.

Also, in addition to traditional lie detectors that look at the electrical conductivity of the skin and blood pressure, there are more sophisticated devices that work with the pupil, eye movements, brain waves, or directly with the electrical activity of the brain or blood circulation in the brain.

Now I have also saved lots of money cooking almost all my meals at home in the past few months.

It had shreds of iceberg lettuce, a scoop of black beans, scoop of guac, scoop of sour cream and a few grilled chicken pieces. It cost $7. Chipotle's bowls with guac cost $14. For a family dinner recently we went to Texas Roadhouse. Everyone got steak and it cost $120 dollars + a tip. $40 a person.

I can make a steak dinner at home for less than $20 and that includes the single steak costing $16. A pack of steaks at the grocery store usually comes in a 3 pack for $48 or a 4 pack for $64. So you could technically make that meal for around $80. Homeade ice tea/2 liter bottle of Dr Pepper/Coke Zero/veggies/bread etc would save you 25% not counting the tip. And thats just for a big rare family meal.  


Now my favorite was Carls Jr. Specifically the Western Bacon Cheeseburger. I made LOVE to those burgers. I was that guy sitting in that restaurant making loud orgasmic sex noises with every bite. Those burgers are so good. Loved ramming those French fries down the back of my throat with a little mayo for lubricant. Now what the f\*ck do I do? The large meal costs $13 !  


I go to the store and spend $7.99 on 2 pounds of ground beef (enough for 6 burgers). One 8 pack of buns is 2 dollars. That right there is $1.25 for the combined amount of beef and bun for a single burger.  


 I buy a romaine lettuce (enough for at least 8 burgers) for $1.50. A beefsteak tomato is $1.25 (enough slices for 5 burgers). Bottle of BBQ sauce/ketchup/ for a dollar each. Bottle of mayo $2 each. Pack of frozen onion rings for $1.50 (enough for 25 burgers if you put 2 on each burger). $1.50 for Great Value season fries which are bomb as f\*ck.  2 liter of Dr Pepper for $2.19 or Dr Thunder for 67 cents. Either way its enough for like 6 glasses of soda. If you want to get kinky you could grab a jar of pickles too for like $2. Bacon costs $6 for a slab of 24 pieces or 50 cents worth of bacon for each burger.   


So that right there ....you can recreate Carls Jr Western Bacon cheeseburger meal at home for like $5 a meal instead of paying $13 a meal a savings of $8 a meal ! And you could save way more as you can make a loaf of bread with a quarter in ingredients. And buying a potato and processing it through a cuisnard. There are tricks to save even more money.

I don't think that the current system of limiting the President to a maximum of two terms, and automatically holding an election every four years where the incumbent President, if they are still in their first term, has to convince the country to vote for them again is working. Because every time a new President is elected, they basically undo everything the previous President did, only to have the next President restore it again. A recent example being Trump withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement only to have Biden re-instate it. The next President, if they are a Republican, will most likely withdraw the US from the agreement again.

My proposal: Rather than automatically holding a Presidential Election every four years, they should instead, during the primaries, have the people vote on whether or not the President is doing a good job and therefore should remain in office. If the majority of the people like the current President, they will stay in office for another four years; no need to hold an election. As long as the people keep voting for the President, they will remain in office; no term limits. If, on the other hand, the majority of the people ""vote the President out of the ~~tribe~~ White House"", the incumbent President will leave office on January 20 of the next year, and the newly-elected President will take office. The previous President will NOT be eligible to be re-elected at a later date.

The system would work similarly to a recall election (at least how it works in my state; not sure about other states), where the people would vote on whether or not the President should remain in office, and at the same time, vote for their preferred candidate in the primaries. If the majority of the people vote for the President to remain in office, that will be the end for another four years. However, if the majority of the people think the current President should NOT remain in office, then the election would proceed as it usually does when the incumbent President is not eligible to run again, with the Democratic and Republican candidates who recived the most votes in the primaries hold debates, the people will vote as usual in November, and the candidate with the most votes becomes the next President.

Recently got thinking about this debate and noticed that the pro-lifers had much stronger arguments then i wanted to accept they did.

Pro-lifers argue that life begins before birth (and by 'life' they really mean something like ""personhood"" or something similar). It occurs to me that in the medical context if we are prepared to define 'death' or 'the end of life' as being linked to the ending of neural activity in the brain or cardiac activity in the heart then we should have a logical reason to accept that the 'beginning of life' should coincide with the beginning of cardiac activity in the heart and neurological activity in the brain. Both of which occur at some point prior to birth. 

Pro-choicer argue that a women's ownership of her body gives her the right to abort a pregnancy. The way this is typically thought of is as a biological version of ""castle doctrine"". Under castle doctrine if someone is trespassing on your land you can legally kill them. For the pro-choicer it doesn't matter if the foetus is a life or a person. What matters is that women have the right to choose.

It occurs to me that this isn't a great argument. Just because you have the right to make a decision doesn't mean it is a morally good decision to make. I have the right to go up to a stranger on the street and tell them that their face is so ugly it makes me want to puke. If i say this I haven't violated their rights in anyway but I have still done something wrong. I think the pro-choice activist has to go further than merely proving that women have the right to abort pregnancy. They have to show that it is an ethical decision to make. 

I think the only way the pro-choicer can do this is to demonstrate that the foetus never constitutes ""a life"" or ""a person"". However the way we define death seems to indicate that these foetuses should count as 'alive' in the relevant sense. 

I still consider myself pro-choice because (1) I still believe in some biological version of castle doctrine - even if enacting it harms something that counts as a person, and (2) I reckon that we can perhaps think of ""life"" and ""death"" on more of a continuum. Even if we define the moment of death as the moment where neurological activity stops those who are approaching death seem to loose their personhood well before this arbitrary point. They also tend to loose their personhood gradually over a long period of time. It's not unthinkable that a foetus with neurological activity is only beginning to gain personhood and hasn't yet achieved it.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017771ECAEF0>

Yeah, lowering your caloric intake does make you lose weight, but these people take it to a levle where they say 1000 calories of fast food is the same for weight loss as 1000 calories of healhty food. because CICO.   


This also doesn't take into consideration that the nutrients eaten also affect what sort of processes your body does, which also use calories.. Without cholesterol and HDL's your body doesn't convert a lot of hormones, so that's energy you're not using. other nutrients are available immediately in a food source, and others are found via bioconverting, which is also taking up energy.  


Nor does this include any sort of thing such as certain people excrete food much faster than their body can absorb all the calories out of the food, or people with hypothyroidism which alone would telll you bodies are not the same.

307,utjqbb,Socialists and Communists miss Donald Trump because he considered them a threat,IanArcad,1653015248.0,2,0.55,39,"### We Will Bury You!!!

Ask a boomer what the greatest threat to the country was when they were growing up, and they would say socialism / communism.  Then they'll show you their Grateful Dead concert paraphernalia and offer to smoke you up.  They're decent folks, if a little dim due to over-medication.

When Gen-X was growing up, we assumed we'd die in nuclear war (aka red skies at night), but it turned out the soviet union was the paper tiger, crumbling before we even left high school.  Our new world order had the US sending troops to a bunch of places like Panama, Mogadishu, Kuwait, and Bosnia that we could barely find on a map, but we never worried about socialists.

9/11 changed everything (kids ask your parents), and by the middle of the decade, it was pretty normal to hear about some guy try to blow up a plane with his shoe and then him and a few of his closest friends getting flown to Guantanamo to get waterboarded.  Since Islamic terrorists were pretty scary, we also had the comic relief terrorists, which were the Eco-terrorists.  For example there was one group called ELF who would burn down empty buildings (which would then be rebuilt).

In the midst of that, there were also the occasional anti-government terrorists, labeled as right-wing, like Tim McVeigh who blew up a Federal building with fertilizer.  (Redneck engineering champion. They rebuilt that building too - unfortunately it wasn't empty.)

### Socialist Revolution = Hurricane Bob

But where were the socialists?  Well, we finally found out in the Trump years, when they figured out that a global pandemic was a good time to start a riot (since people are home doing nothing anyway).  There was rioting and looting in dozes of cities causing billions of dollars of damage - basically as much damage as Hurricane Bob,  (Kids, ask your parents --  actually don't bother they won't remember either.)

(Note - I am giving credit to the socialists for the BLM/Antifa riots because I saw the role that the DSA-LA played here in southern california, using reddit and twitter and their own website to organize, and based on the screenshots Andy Ngo posted in Portland that were similar.)

I don't know how it was in other areas, but here in SoCal, the second that the national guard was called out, they folded like a cheap umbrella (which was incidentally their primary weaponry) and fled as fast as their skateboards could carry them.  And the working class that they claimed to represent was cheering the national guard, not them.

### More capitalism, please.

The problem, of course, is that people wanted capitalism - they wanted to be able to go back to work and to school and to the mall and to their sportsball games etc etc, which is what happened and where we are now.  So while the socialist movements of the 60s were able to help end the war in Vietnam, this one accomplished absolutely nothing.

And while I don't think the government took the socialists all that seriously, they did a little - calling out the national guard in many states, and then trump deployed federal troops to portland to protect buildings, which meant that antifa had someone there to fight every day.  When a big part of your identity is based around being the final nail in the coffin of capitalism, that has to be some decent validation after 20+ years.  At least they weren't being ignored any more.

That lasted all of six months, until the insurrection, when Trump and his supporters literally stormed the capital and killing everybody.  Okay, not really, but it was fun for the establishment left to pretend, and the NYT really did do its best, claiming a capitol police officer was killed.  Now of course we know a lot more, like a lot of the protestors were let into the capitol, the FBI and BLM were both in attendance, and the vast majority haven't been charged with anything much more than trespassing.

And of course establishment Democrats are still beating the ""Republicans are dangerous"" drum for all its worth, investigating PTA moms and blaming mass shootings on Republicans because they read a 180 page manifesto by a self-described authoritarian leftist, hybrid nazi, and green nationalist, who hated conservatives and fox news, and and found something that Tucker Carlson said once.  And then, once again the socialist becomes ""the forgotten man"". 

###Why isn't anyone calling me an enemy combatant and taking me to Gitmo?  Don't I matter?""


So yes, I believe socialists really miss Trump, because they had an enemy, and someone who would fight back against them, even if it was mostly him just treating them like spoiled children.  Because literally the worse thing that can happen to someone who claims to be not just fighting the establishment, but destined to win, is for the establishment to completely dismiss and ignore them.

311,utc7gb,"This make believe ""freedom"" to smoke cigarettes is bullshit",JussaQuestion4,1652991424.0,1,0.54,11,"And this is coming from an actual smoker.

 You either have smokers advocating for it because they're too addicted to quit and are now happily addicted drones for tobacco companies so they won't advocate for greater things.. only things that'll soldifiy their addictions.. or you have people that have never smoked or been addicted to cigarettes a day in their life, trying to advocate for something they're clueless and ignorant about. This society does the stupidest shit.. 

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see and comprehend that advocating for cigarettes is doing the complete opposite of advocating for freedom.. yet so many people conveniently don't grasp that part and pat themselves on the back for thinking ""free"".. when they aren't. 

Advocating for freedom to become addicted to a government backed substance is the opposite of actually being free; you're literally advocating for more drones and robots to addiction. 

You think you're going against the government by crying about them taking away or limiting cigarettes, yet you don't see you're doing the exact thing they want you to do. You think the government actually gives a fuck about prohibiting tobacco? If it didn't make them so much money for decades and generations, they would have by now. That's why it's commonly known that tobacco companies owners and workers have even stated they don't smoke themselves and that it's for the stupid people falling into their addictions and capitalism...

The government has supported tobacco companies for generations. They are getting paid by tobacco companies and this fact isn't new. Just like big pharma. The government WANTS people to smoke cigarettes so more people could become addicted. Just like big pharma. Everyone cries and complains about big pharma yet conveniently turn their nose at tobacco companies.. which are doing the exact damm thing. They're creating addicts because the more addicts they have, the more money they make; the tobacco companies AND the government. 

So take a second to think and really comprehend what the fuck you're advocating for.. you aren't advocating for real freedom. Real freedom would be NOT being controlled and extorted by the government. You think holding a stupid paper saying how much you advocate tobacco is going against the government.. lol its not. You're doing their jobs for them. We should be advocating that the government actually does something about it; that would help the addiction, the money they extort from our health and it would make the country a better place.. but of course not. We never advocate for things that will better everybody as a whole because people are too damn selfish and ignorant. Its all about some make believe personal rights that literally do nothing but ruin families and lives.. how can you call yourself a decent person when you're advocating shit like that? 

No decent person should advocate a drug, a substance, that literally controls you and that commonly often times destroys families to some capacity. How can you advocate for something that leaves children without parents? All for some delusioned bullshit freedom... it's like people really dont think nowadays 🤦🏽‍♂️

So all in all, the basis of the post is; fuck all of these righteous advocates that half ass advocate for things they're either addicted to themselves or they have no clue what tf they're advocating. As an actual smoker, as a person that's watching what it's doing to my mom, and as a person that has seen multiple people quit... please stfu advocating for us. We don't need or want you advocating our delusioned rights and delusioned freedom. You're hurting the country and society more than you are helping anything. If you really want to advocate for freedom.. advocate for good health, advocate for getting out of addictions and control, advocate for the betterment of families and keeping families together, advocate for the countless of young kids that see their parents smoking and start smoking, advocate for all the lost children that have lost their parents and families due to smoking, advocate for everyone that has no money because they spend everything on their addictions, advocate for the clarity of mind, advocate for the strength to quit, the strength, power and knowledge to do better, advocate for the dismantling of the governments control, advocate for all the people affected by tobacco, advocate for enlightenment, advocate for positivity, advocate for healing, advocate for the TRUE freedom of choice to live without being bombarded by unhealthy lifestyles, advocate for logic... and quit advocating for this other bullshit, especially when you're just an outsider looking in. People shouldn't advocate for shit they don't understand, experience or are affected.

321,urvj5f,Doing the exact thing someone dislikes just to annoy them is pretentious and asshole-ish,JussaQuestion4,1652819231.0,0,0.5,18,"I dont understand what's cool, cute or funny about actively doing/saying something to annoy them (being annoyingly ironic). 

For example; https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s2h6n7/your_mom_jokes_are_lame_as_shit/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fgk06x/yo_momma_jokes_are_not_funny/

When people state that things like yo momma jokes aren't funny (they arent), half the comments are usually just people recycling yo momma jokes, knowing the person doesn't like them, to be ironically annoying. And then they're upvoted for it. Why do people constantly think doing this is funny or cool? Why is actively annoying people so supported? 

It just looks like a lack of individuality and a lack of respect tbh. And then it seems like half of the half of comments that do it are recycling something someone already commented like they couldn't even be bothered enough to actually read them before commenting themselves. Its like the only reason they went to the post was to make that comment, which just shows how hive mindey the place is if everyone is using the same jokes without even knowing. 

If I read or hear that someone dislikes something (especially if they're a stranger and have no issues with them), I'm not going to go out of my way to annoy them with it? What does that do for me but just make me look like an asshole? But again that seems to be the culture that's supported on Reddit.. 

""Oh they don't like it? Ima do it anyway!"" Like it just comes off entitled and privileged. I don't see many people or posts that talk about this so I decided to make one. I originally was going to make a post as to how yo momma jokes are overused and unfunny but then got to thinking let me address the main issue: the lack of originality and individuality in general. There's enough posts about yo momma jokes and every single one of them is bombarded with yo momma jokes. I don't know if it's a maturity issue (seems like there's a lot of immature people on here) or just a lack of respect and decency (which is also a maturity issue) but it does get annoying. 

But it goes beyond this tho. Almost anything you say or post you're going to be bombarded with people trying to argue with you, or trying to nitpick something, or trying to ""call something out"", or just doing something. And I understand; its a public platform and people have their own opinions but people will waste all this time and energy going out of their way to discredit or argue with someone. They never once think ""hmm, maybe my opinion really isn't needed right now"" or ""well honestly I don't have much experience with said thing, maybe my two cents is irrelevant and unnecessary"". But no, majority of the time people feel compelled to have everything they think heard (I don't know if it's an ego issue, a privilege issue, a deflection that they aren't being heard in reality, or what). 

And people undoubtedly are going to say ""you're doing the same thing.. voicing your opinion"". Yeah I am voicing my opinion on my own post. But there's a difference between making a post to talk about things and simply going out of your way to a post you dislike to state your disapproval. I don't go to posts I dislike. If the post has a title I dislike; I probably won't open it. If I open a post and dislike it; I'm probably just moving on to a post I do like. Honestly I don't even really look at other posts on Reddit often but if I do I try to be respectful. I don't even remember the last time I've downvoted a post. People spend their whole day going around arguing and disliking posts. I don't care enough about your opinions to argue tbh and if I do, I'll specifically make a post asking for your opinions. I know my opinion isn't always needed or wanted, so I don't go sharing them in comment sections, I simply make my own post about it. People really run around putting others down and calling them names (very first comment they make, very first interaction they have with the internet stranger) for no reason other than to just be negative. 

Look; if you don't like something, you're more than free to go to a post you like and start a conversation there. But not every single thing, not every single post, not every single person and situation needs your two cents. It's really entitled and privileged to think and assume everyone wants and needs it. Just because you could do something, doesn't mean you should. Just because you could say something, doesn't mean you should say something. People need to learn how to be humble but Reddit is too ""edgy"" for that. 

But ultimately this is my two cents. On my own post. I expect to get peoples opinions back since this is a broad statement. There's a difference between giving your feedback on something like this, where it's open and about more than one thing, and actively going to a rap song when you don't even like or listen to rap, just to down it and call it trash. Not every opinion is needed and beneficial. 

And back to the title of the post; quit going around ironically commenting and posting things people dislike and don't want just to try looking like that edgy person that doesn't care and wants to bend the rules.

I wish people were more mature abt this topic, but you can't reason with people who are focused on trying to satisfy their basic and animalistic urges.  
It's quite sad. Humanity hasn't evolved to the point where people feel okay connecting w others without looking for instant gratification. Which proves that as much as we like to claim we're an evolved species, we're clearly not",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x000001777309BCF8>

If you bring something to them that is actually breaking the rules, that the mods enjoy, the mods will just shut your post down.

This sub emphasizes how Reddit is the worst place to post anything.

329,uqscvh,The anti-education anti college trend is dangerous and misleading ! Stop telling kids not to get educated !,Crafty-Bunch-2675,1652695248.0,107,0.68,149,"If you type college into a google or a youtube search , you are immediately flooded with a whole bunch of anti-formal education propaganda all selling the same dream :

**You too can be just like Bill Gates, drop out/skip college all together and become a billionaire**

I have never seen such a pervasive and destructive trend. And its getting worse, not better. This sort of scam is all over the internet. Even just scrolling through facebook or instagram, you are going to come across some scam artist selling the idea that ""you can skip college and become a millionaire just like me, all you have to do is buy my book""

And I get it. It feeds the human ego. It's easier to believe that you have the same level of genius as Bill Gates to start and maintain a software company without formal education ... than to face the harsh reality that most of us are NOT as naturally gifted as Bill Gates, and will need formal education.

College is only useless...if you study a useless degree.

Quincy Jones is an educated musician.

But the story of the random street artist who happens to win a song contest I guess is more interesting.

IMO telling kids to skip college and follow your dreams  to become successful is akin to telling them to take your savings and play the lottery instead of investing.

Obviously someone will win the lottery ....but most of them won't.

This anti-intellectualism is going to make our society gradually less intelligent if it keeps up.

It's very deceptive.

For example, there are many videos of Elon Musk  and Bill Maher claiming that you don't need a college degree ....but both of these men are university educated.

Few things make my blood boil more than the extreme hypocrisy of  rich, college educated men, selling the anti-education pipe dream !",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017771C081D0>

331,uqnyzo,The West is not better than in slavery times,ballsofstyle,1652676711.0,0,0.38,18,"In our own narrative the liberal west feels a huge collective guilt when  it comes to our common past as 'the west'. We have accepted slavery and racism within our borders for a long time and now feel very very ashamed. Thus we are in a continuous struggle to make this right and prove to descendants of slaves that we are better now. 

In the meanwhile modern slavery is rampant and nobody bats an eye. Our entire modern civilization is depending on it for cheap and fast consumer goods. The rich 'slave owners' and exploiters happily participate in our society and we pretend everything is different now. 

In Qatar this year the most popular sporting event will be held. It is quite literally built on the dead bodies of modern slaves who had to build these stadiums under horrible circumstances. 

We have accepted modern colonizing endeavours for influence expansion like the war in Iraq. We've supported and/or facilitated many coups in middle and south America, with a recent one being Bolivia for lithium. When a war(aka peace mission) is deemed not beneficial for the West we just leave, even if the people in the are of the war are not much safer (Afghanistan,  Iraq). 

When other countries wage a war we decide to participate only for strategic reasons. That's why Israel can do what it wants in Palestine. Russia's interference in Georgia was unanswered with public outcry but when they did the same to Ukraine (strategically important for many reasons) we're super angry.

We dont care about slavery. We care that the descendants of slavery in our own countries have become vocal about it. But together with those descendants we are consuming the fruits of modern slavery and expansion drifts as if nothing is going on. 

What we are upset about is decided by how big the impact of  changing it would be on our own lives. So rather than solving the very real and very actual problems, like modern slavery and climate change, we choose to spend much more time on how we treated people in the past. Because saying you're outraged and ashamed is much easier than fighting the things that make our lives so easy. 

We will go down in history as savages, just like our slave owner ancestors.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017771D05DD8>
332,uqmlpx,I love this sub so much,Eddie_078,1652671642.0,7,0.65,14,"Not really a proper opinion but an opinion nonetheless but I just wanna give a shoutout to this sub. This sub truly knows what an unpopular opinion and I ain't just talking about opinions such as edgy right wing opinions that are often shadowbanned by evil progressives. They also include opinions about life and pop culture (e.g. I posted an opinion about how movies are automatically good if they're enjoyable which went well) which people respect compared to the other mainstream unpopularopinion sub.

What do I mean by this? I mean stuff like actually upvoting the opinion for being unpopular and the repliers facilitating a discussion that includes both sides. Want to say thank you all for making this sub a good place. Bye now.",<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x0000017771EB6048>
