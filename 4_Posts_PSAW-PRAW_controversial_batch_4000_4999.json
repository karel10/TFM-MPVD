NSFL [Some of them like the damages](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GrossCutters\/comments\/nzc6nr\/gross_cutter_feels_pleasure_when_boys_are\/).\n\nBoth sides confirm the teachings of Jewish leaders about circumcision's origin and purpose:\n\n>Contrary to the Greeks and Romans, who believed in keeping the glans covered to show sexual control, Philo argued that removing the foreskin was what allowed Jewish men even greater control over their sexual passions. But why circumcise only males? In a volume entitled Questions and Answers on Genesis, Philo\u2019s answer is that\n\n>\u2018\u2018the male has more pleasure in, and desire for, mating than does the female, and he is more ready for it. Therefore Herightly leaves out the female, and **suppresses the undue impulses of the male by the sign of circumcision. [So] it was proper that his pride should be checked by the sign of circumcision**.\u2019\u2019\n\n>[Philo, Questions and Answers 3.47, 241\u201342.] https:\/\/archive.ph\/FfkYQ#selection-1955.0-1975.15\n\n\n>Part III, Chapter 49\n\n>Similarly with regard to circumcision, one of the reasons for is activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible. It has been thought that circumcision perfects what is defective congenitally. This gave the possibility to everyone to raise an objection and to say: How can natural things be defective so that they need to be perfected from outside, all the more because we know how useful the foreskin is for that member? **In fact this commandment has not been prescribed with a view to perfecting what is defective congenitally, but to perfecting what is defective morally. The bodily pain caused to that member is the real purpose of circumcision.** None of the activities necessary for the preservation of the individual is harmed thereby, nor is procreation rendered impossible, but violent concupiscence and lust that goes beyond what is needed are diminished. **The fact that circumcision weakens the faculty of sexual excitement and sometimes perhaps diminishes the pleasure is indubitable. For if at birth this member has been made to bleed and has had its covering taken away from it, it must indubitably be weakened. The Sages, may their memory be blessed, have explicitly stated: It is hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him. In my opinion this is the strongest of the reasons for circumcision.**\n\n>Moses Maimonides http:\/\/www.cirp.org\/library\/cultural\/maimonides\/\n\nI'm guessing these two know a lot more about keeping up with true Jewish traditions than someone today who is Jewish and saying things about circumcision along the lines of:\n\n>Circumcision is not comparable to FGM in any way shape or form.

Men can still orgasm, and good ones.\n\nThen that man has narrowly escaped what these two Jewish leaders wanted the circumcision done for and what these men got r\/circumcisiongrief\n\n>You may not like religion or hold it in high regard, but it is their right to do so and practice as they see fit, whether or not you approve. One of their practices, which to be clear, is NOT a human rights violation by any standard, is circumcision.\n\nI know China gets a lot of flak for their binding feet, and European corsets were damaging women's organs, but at least both of them should be able to conclude in the future that what Philo and Moses are saying above are a human rights violation if conducted on days old infant human beings at the weakest and least mentally developed point of their lives.\n\nSo, I believe if Yahweh was real and wanted circumcision for the purpose laid out by these two famous followers of his and highly regarded leaders of Jewish teachings, then circumcised intactivists and circumsexuals will get to heaven before anyone devotedly Jewish but blaspheming his covenant's cost.","17":"I seen post and videos of them praising Russian and foreign military propaganda as based and then turn around and make jokes about the US is full of \"leftist snowflakes\" and \"weaklings\" as if america hasn't been involved in multiple these past few decades, it's so fucking hypocritical it's funny.","18":"It\u2019s not fair their are millionaires in the world when so many work 40 hours a week for minimum wage.

Right wing libertarianism does not accomplish either of these goals. \n\nIt has a great concept of negative freedoms (lack of external restraint on one's actions) but completely ignored positive freedoms (the capacity to act on ones free will). Workers in a company town technically have the freedom to leave and make money elsewhere but lack the money and capacity to do so.\n\nCapitalism left to it's own devices always degrades into monopoly. The easiest examples to point to are any industry that commands a natural monopoly, in which the cost of entry is so high competition is nonexistent. Water, electricity, internet, social media, and infrastructure in general are all monopolies that are near impossible to break. Neoliberals realized this quite early and created their philosophy. They believe free markets require a strong state to maintain and the spread of neoliberalism has been nearly unstoppable ever since.\n\nNot to mention they can be extremely comedic in their attempts to create right wing libertarian societies. The various attempts to create seafaring utopias have all failed spectacularly. One had a large security force that enforced the rules of the shareholders. Another banned cooking in individual suites and required people to buy from the ships restaurant. \n\nFreedom was never the goal, anybody who believes in this ideology either wants to smoke weed and own guns (just switch to left wing libertarianism if you want that) or believes that they would become the defacto monarch of this theoretical society.","23":"[removed]","24":"i saw eternals in theaters in november and, despite all the negative press surrounding it, i actually enjoyed it. \n\ni thought that it was an interesting story with compelling characters(sprite being my personal favorite), cool action, great world building, and great setup for future MCU movies. after watching the movie, i really didn\\`t get the negative press behind it because it was easily my favorite MCU movie of the year before i saw spiderman no way home. \n\nnow, i\\`m not saying the movie is completely flawless. kit harrington and bill skarsgard\\`s characters are extremely underutilized, the film does rely quite heavily on exposition, and the film just kinda...stops. however, the worst movie of 2021? my friend, have you not seen music, karen, or thunder force? \n\ni give the eternals a B+","25":"[removed]","26":"People often joke around about how teachers react extremely dramatically to stuff like students chewing gum etc.,but as someone who gets extremely irritated by too much sensory overload (I am formally diagnosed with ASD),I actually like it when the teachers do stuff like this even if it occasionally ends up looking like an overreaction.\n\n\nAs I said,I am on the autism spectrum.

They claim the government shouldn't be big all the while support large militaries. For the record, I'm not against big militaries, I just don't find it useful to call myself right wing. Why should I? I can talk about my stances without needing to say I'm right wing. Because saying I'm right wing doesn't explain my views. I can't explain my views with just 'I'm a conservative'\n\nBefore you jump in because you have a political science degree, its possible that in academia these words are well defined. However, I think we should purge it from colloquial terms. No one has been able to give a definition of liberal that everyone or at least 95% can agree on. \n\nalso, to assume one is say, a liberal because they believe in x, and therefore because they are a liberal they believe in y is stupid. I admit there is a correlation with x and y, but to make it definite is the problem. \n\nFinally, to claim that there is this entity that is the right is dumb. 'The right wants to kill education'. What group is this? Can you quantify them? No. \n\nLike its just stupid if I say I think sex work should be legal I'm a dirty leftist feminist, but then when I say we should have fewer refugees being accepted I'm now a right wing Nazi. Well am I left wing or right? \n\nYou can argue my views on sexuality is on the left, whatever that means, and my views about refugees are on the right, and while that might be useful, the problem is we focus on the person. If one has a left leaning view then a right leaning view, do they cancel out? \n\nIt goes without saying placing yourself on the left or on the right leads to tribalism. You create this bogey monster and claim anyone criticizing you is on the left and to be defeated. (Or right)","70":"Its unpopular because people all over the country seem to be leaning towards wanting college to be free. I can get behind highschool being free since everyone follows the same curriculum. The problem with college is that everyone specializes in their own thing. I think we should let the market decide what is more valuable. If you make it free then we are spending money on sy, women's studies that is not in demand. This means tax payers are paying money for degrees that don't necessarily give results. \n\nI think its unpopular on Reddit because people seem to have this idea that letting the market decide things is bad. \n\nI think if you flunk and the state pays for your education, its a bad investment. Yes, education helps people be economic contributes, but its a risk, especially for larger countries.","71":"Tdlr: if your organs are healthy they should be donated after you die there\u2019s no reason why they shouldn\u2019t. \n\nUnless it goes against your religion or your families religion somehow I guess. \n\n But other than that I find it pretty selfish if someone is against donating their organs or their family members organs (not their entire body just their organs). Like seriously there are people dying because they\u2019re in such an unfortunate position in life that they never asked for. And you want to take your after-death healthy organs with you to the grave? For what? You want your healthy organs to be cremated after death? For what?? It makes no difference on your death or what happens to you after death. Even if you have an open casket funeral\u2026 people attending your funeral aren\u2019t gonna open your dead body up and be mad you're missing a kidney or some shit. You could save a persons life so their family doesn\u2019t have to go through what your friends and family will have to go through.","72":"I mean college shouldn't be free because it's not mandatory. If it was mandatory that everyone in the country went to college, it would be asinine to make them pay for it, right? College isn't mandatory though, so why should we force people to give their taxes to an education program that runs more like a business than school? If college was mandatory, as in, everybody in the country was \\*forced\\* to go to college like they are K-12, then to make it a paid education would be stupid and heavily fought against. However, it isn't, so there's no need to make it a tax-provided service.","73":"I have personal issues that make it extremely uncomfortable to be around dogs. I don\u2019t like dogs and don\u2019t want them around me. No I do not abuse or hurt dogs.\n\nHowever my entire life has been filled with seeing dog owners letting dogs off a leash, dogs running up to me and jumping on me and if I complain about it the owners always say \u201cmy dog won\u2019t hurt you\u201d. Never mind the fact it\u2019s a terrifying experience for me to have dogs jump on me or be around me off leash.","74":"A newborn isn't really any more intelligent, conscious or self aware than a dog or pig is, so they shouldn't really be counted as people (not to say that they should have no rights, but rather that they should have something more like animal rights). I'm not sure exactly when a baby becomes a person, and it's certainly a gradual process that likely happens at different times for different people, but I'd guess it's somewhere between 6 months and 3 years old.\n\nI also think that the fact society disagrees with this so much is a really big problem in that it means our conception of personhood is really messed up (and that'll be extremely important in the future when there are sentient AIs that should be getting \"human\" rights).","75":"Dude over there living in his white community, with a white spouse, who only has white friends, who specifically sends his kids to white schools, goes to white church, eating his White-o's with 100% fat white milk, while watching the very white Friends, talking about how he hates division lmao. \n\n\nHow the modern white-woke Conservative uses \"Division\", is similar to people who say \"we need to have an honest conversation about race\". They don't want an honest conversation, they simply want you to capitulate to all of their talking points. What the white-wokes actually mean by \"Division\" is : \"you're trying to stop me from being racist, in turn, taking away all of my unearned white privileges. We as racists love our privilege and don't want that to change, therefore, you are necessarily wrong \". That's all it is, man. It really is that simple and is the foundation from which the white-woke Marxists operate. \n\n\nNah, we've always been divided. Back then it was by force, today it is by choice. Jim Crow, Segregation, etc, was only possible because it's what white people wanted, which is why the same behavior is seen today, despite overturning forced segregation. Saying everything was just fine and dandy, until a couple of purple haired feminists on twitter came and mucked it all up, is white woke Marxist propaganda, easily refuted with basic history. That's because it's fundamentally about maintaining white hegemony.","76":"[removed]","77":"These kinds of arguments have been made over and over to fuel the panic surrounding CRT but I challenge anyone to find a piece of legislation or proposed legislation to censor dissenting perspectives coming from the CRT side.  Getting \u201ccancelled\u201d on Twitter or private social media companies deciding what to allow is in no way comparable to actual laws that limit what teachers can and can\u2019t talk about.  The \u201cstop woke\u201d bill in Florida is effectively no different from the Ministry of Truth in 1984.  The accusation is constantly thrown around that proponents of CRT try to silence their critics by calling them racists.  However I only see the opposite happening.  Multiple states are passing laws outlawing the teaching of any material related to CRT based on the accusation that it is \u201canti white racism\u201d.  However that accusation is not fact but opinion.  Certainly it is the opinion of the Harvard School of Law where CRT was developed that it is not anti white racism but rather a critical analysis of the ways systemic racism is perpetuated and interacts with the law.  If the anti-CRT side feels so confident that their views concerning systemic racism are correct than why are they making opposing viewpoints illegal?  That makes it look like they know they are wrong and are threatened by the truth.  The whole point of education is to be exposed to diverse perspectives and form your own opinion using critical analysis.  I read \u201cThe Communist Manifesto\u201d in high school history, that doesn\u2019t mean I was being indoctrinated into Communism.  How can you expect students to be able to do this if you are outlawing and censoring all materials from perspectives you don\u2019t agree with?  That sounds like actual indoctrination.","78":"[deleted]","79":"Is it gonna put me out of a job? yes if I don't find other skills. However, for me, it's not a job I would wish on anyone else. I know people will say that some people might like their job. That might be true, but in my opinion, we are better off if service workers are replaced by machines. \n\nMost service workers are not necessary. A machine can full fill the roles too. There probably just needs a maintenance guy and the guy who answers questions that the software didn't account for. Then the customer service person just tells maintenance guy to add updates to the machines.\n\nI know this sounds very dystopian, where shit like sci first stories where everyone is in pods, but I don't know, its an utopia for me. \n\ndespite being service worker, some service workers annoy me. And sometimes customers annoy me. I personally think humans are not worth the stress to talk to. If we can reduce the number of human interactions, I would. And I think that is the unpopular part. People talk about how this day and age we are on our cell phones. Its true. yeah video games damage my eyes so that's something I'm trying to kick, however, even social media tires me.\n\nHumans to me, are for the most part mean spirited.","80":"And that's all.\n\nIt's a descriptive statement, not a prescriptive one, and it's one we desperately need to accept if rights are to be restored. \n\nTo be honest though, given the coronavirus pandemic and the fact that almost everyone willingly and blithely threw away not only their rights but the rights of everyone else just to buy themselves the illusion of safety, love and belonging, I don't think rights are even a good way to convince people not to mistreat or abuse others.\n\nI think we all would be better off if we were just brutally honest with each other and just made compacts stating that we will not do or approve of certain things being done to each other, and accept that some people are going to do certain things we don't like, to be able to interact with each other and have it a civilization. Have a value system that's collectively agreed upon instead of rights which are nebulous and ultimately powerless in the face of the circumstances in which they are needed the most, or laws that are violently enforced by the state and cannot be realistically applied in all or even most circumstances and often go against the state's best interests to enforce.\n\nWe could hand out weapons to every human being to equalize the playing field and make those kinds of negotiations possible and necessary, so bullies can't use inherent power advantages whether they be violent or social to subjugate and abuse others.","81":"So, recently I got a new phone. I was skeptical as it wasn't a big name flagship in the phone industry, but it has the features I was looking for. One of these is a 3.5mm headphone jack. I believe wired headphones or earbuds are far superior and safer than anything exclusively wireless or Bluetooth. That's just my opinion, consistent with my functional usage needs. \n\nThe type of phone doesn't matter as much as the elements of it that I use and need such as the headphone jack and the fact that it is customizable, but I'll say it anyway. It's a Moto Stylus 5G 2021. For example, it does not have ads in native apps such as the music app like Samsung started doing. \n\nThis phone did not even come with a native Gallery app so I was able to choose whatever app I decided. Some people would say that is left of a feature and more of a nuisance, but I disagree. I am all about user customization and more particularly, user freedom.\n\nI feel it's unfair to compare my previous Samsung with this phone's features much further in this post as the earlier Samsung was supposedly factory unlocked but it was still Samsung which means the firmware and stock apps were had Samsung's wet blanket of control over them, while this new phone is a carrier phone. So, apples to oranges in those areas which I'll avoid when possible.\n\nFor me, ditching Samsung for the less \"popular\" brand Motorola has been the right decision due to my disagreement with Samsung's decisions.\nThese decisions are:\n\n- To be a follower (of Apple who removed their 3.5mm first) instead of a leader in the industry.\n\n- Dictating heavy-handed decisions regarding users' needs and requests en masse (Ok Google, remember dark\/black theme user requests in Android for YEARS?)\n\n- Ethical questions regarding ads in stock aps (particularly the music app) - or, more\n specifically, any kind of subscription-based business model that is unnecessary and therefore greedy.\n\nIt seems all these decisions are faced companies which gain any type of industry domination (Looking at you, gaming companies) companies fail to recognize the ones who made them great in the first place - their customers.\n\nI came across an article saying Samsung is going to stop putting ads in their stock apps. Great, but for me, it is too little too late as I have already moved on to a better company's product for good. Just because a big name is hugely popular does not mean the company makes the right decision for all users.\n\nAlso, I never noticed a premium \"flagship\" phone \"feature\" that didn't seem like a gimmick or unnecessary waste of money or time that actually enhanced the official day to day use of my phone. Curved screen and wireless charging to me, were more of a hassle or liability than they were worth.\n\nGoodbye, Samsung.","82":"I'm honestly completely fine with cows being murdered. It's not like I'm just \"ignoring the cruel truth\" or something like that. \n\nMost vegans I know say something like \"no but you are only seeing what you're eating, and not who was murdered because of it\".\n\nAnd I do. The truth is, I don't care. I would even kill the cow myself if it was necessary. All for those delicious cuts of meat.\n\nIs it bad environmentally speaking? Yes, it really is. Do I care? No, not really. And I'm not going to say something like \"But we're screwed anyway so might as well not stop\", it's more like, I don't care","83":"[deleted]","84":"But the trick is you should be doing it in your sleep without actually wanting to do it.

But at least with dogs, there is a bond that is formed.\n\nSo that\u2019s basically it.

They could restrict the videos in Japan, as many people do. It's pretty pathetic to be mad you are having problems doing that AFTER the claims. You should had done it years ago. You could also had contacted Toei and tried making a deal (like, a share of revenue). Both of those actions would make things a lot better\n\n3) you can feel that the whole case is based on emotion. There is no legal ground here. Using phrases like \" life destroying\" or \"stealing my work\"...\n\n4) boycotting Toei himself is okay, absolutely. Asking for people to boycott them too is a little too far. Directly telling Toei, with japanese translation, that if they don't step back millions of people will boycott them... It's too much. It was disrespectful to use his subscribers like that. He should had gone with \"I am willing to discuss it with you directly and so we can make a deal\". You need to make concessions .\n\n5) Oda should never be part of this. He is just a mangaka. While he is really popular, he has nothing to do with this. That's like complaining to GRRM that Game of Thrones has bad actors. Also, it just feels cheap. \n- appealing to One Piece lore. It's childish.\n- telling Oda to \"stand by his community\". As if Mark and his fans represent everyone. While putting pressure on Oda, who has no obligation to do it.\n- telling Oda \"your story told me to...\". It makes Oda seem like the one who provoked the whole thing.","112":"[removed]","113":"If you oppose measures to achieve racial equity, than you're racist.\n\nThere is literally no depth to that - it's as simple as that.","114":"A lot of people say that \"teach men not to rape\" is a good solution to stop rape. But think about it, who commits rape? Mostly psychopathic people, who happen to be men. And what's a common factor among psychopaths? They don't care about what society says or believes in. Essentially saying \"don't rape\" is the same as saying \"don't murder\"; none of them will stop rape and murder respectively. Why? Precisely because rapists and murderers are immoral people who do NOT care about morality, law and humanity.\n\nTherefore, my solution is simple. Legalise STATE CONTROLLED prostitution. No, not that cliche prostitution, but a kind of prostitution wherein women (and\/or men) work by their own wish, and are supported by the nation. These sex workers would regularly undergo HIV\/AIDS testing, the way pornstars do. The state control would mean that prostitution would be non-profit (only the sex workers would get 100% of the income) and that there would be no chance of extortion or human trafficking.\n\nThis would solve one of the greatest societal problems today. Sexually frustrated men and women could seek out sexual satisfaction in a safe controlled manner. This would definitely NOT stop rape altogether, but hey, I feel it would certainly significantly reduce the frequency of rape.","115":"[removed]","116":"\nI got this thought while watching Hillary Clinton's Howard Stern interview.

How do you survive? You must gather resources by foraging or trading with other humans to get your food, water and shelter from the elements. Nature does not just give them to you, effort must be spent to obtain them. \n\nExpand this into the modern day. Most land\/resources are owned by others, so in order to obtain the necessary resources to survive one must trade with others. What resource do you have to trade? Your labor. You must trade your time\/effort to someone else for the resources needed to survival, again nature doesn't strictly hand them to you. \n\nWhat determines how much someone gives you for your labor? They answer is how much value they believe that you add to them. Therefore, how useful you are to another is directly proportional to the amount you paid for your work. \n\n'Woah man, not everything is strictly about economic transactions. Sometimes you add value to someone's life just by being there for them'\n\nYou know what? This is 100% true. But, it's not by your inherent value that they care about it, it's based on the time and effort you've put towards getting to know each other. Additionally, the caliber of each person will vary on how much this relationship pans out. For instance, you could be friends, close friends, with someone for decades, but they wouldn't let you sleep on their couch if you were suddenly homeless whereas other people would let you do it after only knowing you for a week or two. \n\nThe next thing someone might ask is 'well what about children'? Well I ask you, do you really care about children starving in the world or are you just too empathic to look a child directly in front of you, in the eye, begging for food 'no'? I would bet it is the latter and not the former because how many of you are donating money\/effort in ending hunger around the world right now? \n\nAll human interactions have the following thought, whether it is direct\/overt or subconscious: how does this action benefit me? Is this worth it? Will this person pay me back either monetarily or benefiting some other way from our relationship (such as not feeling lonely, receiving love, affection, gifts etc)? \n\nThere is nothing wrong with this. It is how we evolved and it's how we can function healthily but this is reality and I'm tired of pretending it's not (wink)","120":"It's just an alternative way of seeing the character and doesn't change their canon race.

I grew up poor. We almost got evicted because we almost couldn't pay the bills. But now we are ok. I still hold the 'eat the rich' mentalities is dumb. I am now a lower middle class, I am richer than I was before, but I am still nowhere 'rich'. I got like, maybe 50$ left over after everything every month? I have a 15$ netflix. I could technically give it up and get like a 60$ left over? But I see so many middle classers saying the rich should give up their luxuries because 'poor people exist'. I find it funny, they don't speak for me, but even if they did, would they be willing to give up their luxuries for ME? because, in my eyes, my 15$ luxury doesn't compare to their, say, middle class 500$ resort weekend get away.\n\nYes, someone will say this is the 'slippery slope fallacy', but it's not. Please tell me what line do you draw before the rich shouldn't have their money? It's nonsense. I don't think the 'rich people must give their money away' is good economics.\n\nUntil you are willing to give up all your luxuries, I don't think you should lecture others on giving up theirs. Tell me your line and why.\n\nThe unpopular part I guess is, people think me being poor means I would agree the 'rich' must give up their money or have a salary cap or some shit. To me, that's not the way to make the poor not poor. I agree with taxes to some degree, but people are making ridiculously high numbers, like if you make over a million you should be taxed 20%, that's too high in my opinion","122":"If someone is unvaccinated, they should have to wait until their is no more vaccinated individuals who need a space in the hospital before they get an available spot.\n\nIt's not just about covid19 its about everyone else who needs treatment who can't get it because they are filled with unvaccinated idiots who decide that they want science to save them only after they get close to death.\n\nMinor illness that could have been prevented by early detection  becomes major, major illness like cancer because deadlier because people aren't able to get check ups.","123":"[removed]","124":"[removed]","125":"[removed]","126":"[removed]","127":"There are a few cases where stealing is understandable\/\"forgivable\". Namely people who steal food to eat or people who otherwise live under extreme poverty, as there is no point trying to criminalize survival instinct. Another case is petty theft, where the thief should just be forced to give back whatever they stole and maybe an extra fee for their troubles.\n\nHowever IMO anything futher or other than that should be treated as a crime. Robbery is just inexcusable. No hardship can justify you threatening or hurting (often with a deadly weapon at hand) someone over their rightful belongings. And I see no justification for stealing from others beyond the cases I mentioned before.\n\nCommon counter-arguments I hear (speacially on Reddit) it's that: It's acceptable to steal from the rich, It\u00b4s ok to steal from Corporations and It's ok to steal insured property. All, IMO, are BS:\n\n\\- It's acceptable to steal from the rich: The rich are just as entitled to the protection of the law as you are. The victim being rich and the criminal being poor should mean nothing. Would it be ok to a poor man r\\*pe a rich woman, or poor mass-murderer to shoot up a place full rich people ? Most reasonable people would say ***no***.\n\n\\-it\u00b4s ok to steal from Corporations: Same as the first. It's okay to blow up an Amazon facility or set a KFC ablaze because they are Big Money ? Besides, if you rob an amazon warehouse, you will not be pointing your gun at Jeff Bezos, you will be doing that to a minimum-wage bathroom-less employee. And that's not getting into the macro-effects of widespread stealing from business, such as they pulling out operations.\n\n\\-It's ok to steal insured property: Even if we assume all stolen property are insured, which is simply not true, you would still be severely inconveniencing someone else.","128":"[removed]","129":"[deleted]","130":"As a man, I think every man should wipe the rim of piss droplets and put the seat down when they piss, even if there are no women around.

I'll just say it upfront: identifying as \"x-American\" is not the same as identifying as x. Being x-American doesn't make you a spokesperson for x. I agree that the people who do that are very disrespectful, but that's not what this is. \n\nIdentifying as \"x\"-American simply means that you have significant ancestry in said country, and try to both partake in and celebrate the culture you share with the descendents of other immigrants from said country. That's it. \n\nTake Irish-Americans, for example. We've got our own history of our ancestors coming over from the famine in Ireland to climb out of poverty in the face of anti-Catholic discrimination. Is that story American? Yes. But that's not something that people with ancestry in the Mayflower or Japan can claim as their own, despite them also being as  American as I. But it doesn't stop there! We've got our own heroes, like the Irish Brigade of the Civil War. We have our own movies like \"Gangs of New York\" or \"Boondock Saints\". We have our own music, like the Dropkick Murphys. \n\nAre all these things American? Yes, absolutely. But in the same way that nobody would question that something like \"The Boondocks\" is both fully American and distinctly African-American, one should be able to understand the same of Irish-Americans. And it's the same with Italian-Americans, Greek-Americans, or what have you. \n\nWhy is this something important to Americans? Because we all grow up learning about how our ancestors came from somewhere else. Whereas people in other (non-former colonial) countries can figure their ancestors probably lived in the same general area for centuries, Americans know their ancestors have only been American for max a few centuries - and in many cases not that much. So, we Americans naturally want to know which story our ancestors come from. It's melting pot culture. \n\nIt's important, too. Historically, much of the absolute worst of racism has come from groups who try to assert themselves as \"true Americans\". That's where you get shameful histories like the KKK of the 1920's. It's telling that today's KKK portrays \"whites\" as true Americans. The concept of race is a completely artificial way of grouping people with little to nothing in common past their skin tone, but it's used to justify hate. \n\nReminding people of their immigrant roots encourages them to distance themselves from identifying themselves as \"true, white Americans\" and excluding immigrants. That's probably why (anecdotally) I've noted that first generation immigrants seem to be the most enthusiastic about identifying other Americans with their ancestry. It makes sense.  It makes them feel less out of place.\n\nTl;dr every American traces back from an immigrant group and identifying with that group is both justified and and an important part of being American.","135":"\nI'm a guy, but the more female friends I make the more I realise this.

He had been seen and caught on camera going through a house-under-construction multiple times in the middle of the night.\n\nOn the day he was killed Arbery was seen \"jogging\" through the neighborhood again. He enters the house which a neighbor sees and calls the police, he then sprints out of the house and runs down the street. The 2 McMicheals see this and then get in their truck and chase after him, a 3rd neighbor (Roddie) sees them and gets in his truck and follows them. \n\nThe McMicheals and Roddie chase Arbery for around 4-5 minutes until we see what happens in the video - The McMicheals get ahead of Arbery and stop, Arbery runs around the truck and grabs the gun in Travis McMicheals hands. They fight over the gun and Travis ends up shooting Arbery.\n\n----\nMorally:\n\nThey didn't do anything wrong. McMichael's had good reason to suspect Arbery of committing felony burglary and any sane person seeing their friends house being broken into is going feel anger about it.\n\nThe McMicheals knew Arbery was a burglary suspect and were trying to do good on their neighbors by chasing after a suspected criminal. They weren't chasing after him to kill him, they were chasing after him to question him and detain him for the police.\n\nThey didn't shoot him because he was black. They didn't shoot him because they thought he was stealing. They shot him because he tried to grab Travis McMicheals shotgun and started punching him in the face. At that point, even if we assume the McMicheals and Rhoddie were absolutely wrong about everything before; It is completely unreasonable to say they should or could have done anything else other than defend themselves by shooting Arbery.\n\nWith Roddie it's not even a question, all he did was follow, film, and call the police. \n\n----\nLegally:\n\nThe McMichaels never actually attempted to detain Arbery. They never attacked, restrained, or pointed their weapons at him. They merely followed him whilst asking him to stop and talk.\n\nHowever, the McMichael's absolutely had reasonable and probable grounds to suspect Ahmaud Arbery of committing felony burglary. This (should have) secured them the right to detain Arbery until police could arrive and investigate. They were lawfully open carrying firearms, an inviolable right recognized by the Second Amendment and entirely reasonable when detaining a suspected fleeing felon. Rather than stopping and waiting for law enforcement to arrive, Arbery attempted to wrestle a weapon from one of them. This escalated a \"detainment\" on suspicion of burglary to putting McMichaels in fear of imminent death under which use of deadly force is permitted.\n\nAdditionally, in the trial both the prosecution and defense agreed that whether anything they did was legal depends on whether they were justified in performing a citizens arrest. The Georgia citizens arrest law is just 2 sentences:\n\n*\"A private person may arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge. If the offense is a felony and the offender is escaping or attempting to escape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion.\"*\n\nThe defense argued that the first sentence is referring to misdemeanors and the second is referring to felonies. The prosecution argued that both sentences applied to felonies. \n\nThe defenses interpretation makes sense; If it's a misdemeanor you need to have absolute certainty that a crime took place before you tackle someone to the ground. If it's a felony, and they are running away, you only need to have a reasonable suspicion that someone did something before you chase after them. Again this makes sense, it's not sensible for someone to detain a kid because they think he just shoplifted a box of cookies. It is sensible for someone to chase after a guy who looks like he just committed a murder.\n\nThe prosecutions argument doesn't; They were arguing that you need 100% certainty of any crime and **also** 51% suspicion if it's a felony before you can perform a citizens arrest. \nNot only does this not make any logical sense to be interpreted that way it does not make sense fore the state to write the law that way.\n\nWhen a situation like this occurs where there are disagreements about the interpretation of the law under the rule of lenity the judge is supposed to judge in favor of the defense. As the state had complete control over how the law was written any ambiguity should be ruled in favor of the defense. Instead what the judge did was give the jury both interpretations and let them decide. This is a horrible improper way of judging a trial.","186":"I hate it.

In fact, this opinion stems from me rescinding my support of a rule I proposed.\n\nAs most of you may know, last week a rule was put to poll on whether or not we should extend protections to all groups, not just those protected by Reddit. When I first proposed the rule change in modmail, my intention was to ban racist and discriminatory behavior. However, as I\u2019ve recently found out from senior mod staff (whom I will not name, as I do not endorse doxxing), the new rule would be used to ban discussion in support of certain religious practices, namely one often associated with Judaism and Islam. This goes contrary to what I wanted the rule to stand for. By banning discussion of that topic, it sets the precedent for religious discrimination in moderating, which I am absolutely against. \n\nHere\u2019s a link to the poll: https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/TrueUnpopularOpinion\/comments\/r2n57l\/_\/hm5qt8z\/?context=1\n\nPlease, I ask of you to speak out against religious persecution.

As income requires realization of gain, and if bitcoins are sitting in a wallet unused then they haven't been realized yet by a taxpayer.  This would be the equivalent of taxing someone for $1000 in unrealized gain on stock appreciation, because the crypto in my wallet can depreciate and lose value just as the stock can lose value.\n\nPaying taxes requires realization of gain, and until I actually go to use my mining profits I haven't gained anything.

People seem to have lost the concept that it is okay for people to disagree, even when it is against things like science and such. It\u2019s okay to disagree but this push to actively silence with impunity any opinion that goes against widely accepted science should not be encouraged or viewed as \u201cthe bare minimum\u201d of what you should do.

I don't buy that for a second. When your kids are young their behavior is a direct reflection on your parenting skills. If they are loud, obnoxious, insolent little shits who speak without being spoken to by adults or act inappropriately in public that is and should be a reflection on the parents. I hardly ever blame the kid. I blame the parents. \n\nWhen children grow up into adolescence and teenage years their behavior is ALSO a reflection on their parenting. If they turn into a goth or something that's embarrassing for the parents, and it's likely due to some deficiency in their parenting skills. \n\nWhen children grow up and get jobs they are STILL direct reflections on their parents' ability to built an adult man or woman who is capable of supporting themselves and\/or their families. If they grow up to be a welfare mooch or a Wendy's porter then that is a reflection on the job their parents did. \n\nNow, this doesn't absolve children from responsibility for their own life and decisions. Parents guide and teach their children and are very responsible for how they turn out, but the child should also see this fact and strive to improve themselves and make the most of themselves so as to reflect well upon their parents.","202":"[removed]","203":"","204":" \n\n# Make Male Genital Mutilation (Circumcision) an offence unless medically required   \n\nI\u2019m asking the UK Government to criminalise circumcision, no  exceptions for Religious circumstances, unless it has to be done for  medical reasons, such as an infection.

By removing the expectation that women be nurturing, this social bias in rulings will be mitigated. Encouraging boys and men to embrace nurturing behaviors and creating a social environment where those behaviors are not seen as weak is definitely concordant with feminist views on the issue.\n\n\n---\n\n**Problem:** Women are more likely to be stay-at-home caregivers and to do most of the emotional labor of child rearing. When assessing the welfare of the child the parent who does most of the labor of child rearing usually gets custody, that happens to be women more often.\n \n**Feminist solution:** Women enter the workforce more often and men become stay at home dads more often. The more a man engages in the physical and emotional labor of child rearing, the more likely he will be seen as a viable candidate for custody. By creating more situations where it is clear that the father performs many of the duties of child rearing it will make a stronger case for the father keeping custody of the child.\n\n---\n\nOn top of the adequacy of these feminist solutions, I see a lot of men's rights spaces advocating a sort of traditional masculinity that at times eschews nurturing behaviors or sees staying at home to care for children as emasculating. And to those people, they can't exactly have it both ways to continue playing into a societal belief of men as emotionally distant providers and also believing that they should be granted custody of their children (who unquestionably need nurturing to develop into healthy adults).","206":"Usually people misunderstand what s right means \n\n'I think gays are sinners'.

I could have an unhealthy obsession, but the 'what aboutism doesn't address the heart of the issue'. The liberals are the ruling party right now, so of course I focus on them. Even if I said the flaws of the liberal party are bad but not in the green party, it is either true that Trudeau did some non politically correct stuff or he didn't, regardless if the green party leader did it too or not. \n\nAlso, the common arguments with religion is so funny. It's either Christianity or Islam. If I criticize Islam it's 'what about christianity'. The funny thing is, people have no arguments after that if I say 'fuck em both. Neither has convincing evidence for a god'. If I criticize Christianity people assume that I'm \"a left wing who loves Islam\" The Quran has their bits, and the Bible has crazy bits. But whataboutism would derail conversations. Show me evidence that Mo really did fly to the moon.

Having sex for fun is like eating when you're not really hungry. I've had sex for the last time 3 years ago and not focusing on it is great. Somehow, it turns out focusing on things that are either more productive or an easier way of having fun wastes less of my time and energy. Sure, sex feels good, but so do many other things that don't require as much compromise. \n\nThen you have the people who bring up the health benefits of having sex. Sure, it does have its benefits. The benefits of having sex for an hour are also easily outweighed by eating a Kit Kat or a hot dog the next minute. These benefits are minimal; you don't see people whose extreme health can be linked to sex. Plus, there are better ways to ensure your health that also don't depend on having to find someone who's down to do that with you first. Going for a walk is completely free. \n\nUnless you're in a relationship, finding partners to have sex with is mostly an expensive and tiresome thing. The effort-to-benefit ratio is extremely low. Most people won't last longer than 30 minutes (and if you do last longer than that, odds are one of you is getting sore and bored), so sex is really a crack addiction. People fiend for their 15 minute high. \n\nAnd as for people in relationships, sex is really just a shared addiction. It's what they do when they can't think of anything better to do. \n\nMasturbation is a healthier, safer way of getting sexual relief and I legitimately don't get why it's seen as something so bad by sex addicts. It's literally just solo sex. If you're one of these people who see sex as socially successful and masturbation as a loser thing, you're out your mind and completely self-absorbed. The difference is that masturbation is a personal thing that's not gonna bother anyone. \n\nSociety is obsessed with sex.

They are better than some of the other people out there - because even if they make mistakes from time to time, they are **self-aware** and are at least trying to address their **prejudices.**\n\nThey also (hopefully) understand that when minorities call out people for being discriminatory towards them, they are not talking about *them*, but rather they\u2019re talking about a *specific group of white people* who continue to deny this fact of reality.\n\nStop trying to make the people who have the courage to step outside of themselves and put themselves in someone else\u2019s shoes out, as people who look down on minorities or villains - at least they have the courage to put their ego aside to address this very real problem - they are **not** *racists*.","239":"I once saw a movie that I will not spoil by not naming it, where the main character is a straight male yet tells a story where his ultimate revenge plan climaxed by forcing his antagonist to suck his dick. And he told this story with glee.  But watching it, I couldn't help to think this was a lose-lose scenario. Like in South Park, when Eric Cartman brags about getting Butter's mouth on his dick, that's nothing to brag about. If you're a straight male and you get another straight male to suck your dick, that's not a power dominance move, that's a lose-lose proposition.","240":"[removed]","241":"[https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2020\/08\/20\/a-profile-of-single-americans\/](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/social-trends\/2020\/08\/20\/a-profile-of-single-americans\/)\n\nOf course this is dependent on country, but I see this often from people in USA saying how the economy or how things are more expensive leads people no room for dating, or tinder is bad for dating etc. The common concern is 'well when men are single, they become violent incels'. It is either a) sexist to assume men will become violent or b) if it is true that they become violent, then some body fucked up in raising them. And no, I'm not blaming just men. Both men and women involved in raising this fucking twat would be guilty. We as a society need to drill it in people's head that its ok to not get what you want, but it's not people's fault. Society doesn't need to shaped in a way that gives you what you want if it comes at the expense of others.\n\nLooking at this, you need to ask yourself, why are (assuming your fears are true) men becoming more violent when single than women when there is an equal amount of single women?\n\nFor example, if I as a highly sexual person finds that the sex workers market is small and very few male sex workers exist to cater to my needs, it's not a failing of the society. If a society has a small market for ugly men or whatever women find unattractive, society doesn't need to be shaped in such a way that allows them to find a partner.\n\nThe unpopular part is, I'm fine with tinder. If I can't find a partner in real life because most people decide to put their efforts on tinder, so be it. I'm old school, and it's fine if the dating world doesn't work the way I work.\n\nIf the dating world is formed in such a way that increase the amount of single men and women, that's people's choice. If you are whining about people not dating you, well, that's their choice.\n\nI have zero compassion for people who think that society is failing because they can't get what they want. Just feels like princess syndrome.","242":"\"So many activities!\"\n\n\"Did we just become best friends?\"\n\n\"This is going to sound weird, but for a second, I think you took on the shape of a unicorn.\"\n\n\"I feel like a lightning bolt hit the tip of my penis!\"\n\nAm I crazy or do these not work as one-liners?

This is a legitimate complaint....you can see that these companies have the resources to pay more and probably should, right? **WRONG**.\n\nThe thing about these employees is that they are the lowest common denominator of the workforce. These are people who literally would not be employed if they weren't employed by these companies. They are people who have no skills, no motivation, no ambition, etc. There are only so many gas station attendant jobs out there for people like this. \n\nSo if Amazon or Walmart managed to automate most of their workforces or if they didn't exist these people who are employed by them wouldn't just be receiving some assistance. The taxpayer would be footing all their bills. The government would spend even more money on keeping these leeches alive. Some would probably resort to crime as well, increasing costs for the taxpayer.\n\nSo in the end Amazon and Walmart and other employers are actually doing the taxpayer a service by at least paying these people SOMETHING to offset the taxpayer's obligation. \n\nAs for the worker, they agree to do the work for $xx and there's a line out the door to replace them.","246":"There's several reasons here that make anyone that uses an adblocker or gets around paywalls a shit person\n\nIt severely impacts local and good journalism.

Promiscuity? If I want yo have sex with a lot of men, that's my business. If you want to know the numbers your partner has because of std, just ask her. The number is irrelevant. Same with men. \n\nReligion? Doesn't really matter. And I say this as an atheist that criticizes religion a lot. The only criticism I have with religious people is, if I am sinning, that's my business. Yes, if someone is doing bad things, ie smoking, I still wouldn't want it illegal if its in their own private space. Etc. \n\nOver all I think all our problems can be solved if we fix this defect.

Someones existence is not a political debate.\n\nAnother example, when a women is a shallow character who is \"strong\" people only drag on them for being a \"shallow strong woman\" and not a shallow character where her gender doesnt matter.\n\nWith sexuality in general, people get offended over people existing in shows or movies, for example gay or trans characters. Their existence isnt going to hurt you, someone existing isnt going to turn your kid gay.

A developing embryo\/fetus doesn't magically become human past a certain day\/hour\/second\/nanosecond or else it would have been properly defined by the government. \n\nOnce an egg is fertilized it's already human as it's already considered to be exactly the same species as human. Calling a zygote inhuman is the same as calling a child\/elderly inhuman compared to an adult. If it's not human then what is it? \n\nYou could say that the consciousness is the defining factor but then what about a person in coma? They are not conscious but we don't kill them unless certain conditions are met, but we do kill humans in development. \n\n\"My body, my rules\" also doesn't make sense as it doesn't justify genocide. \n\nJust to make it clear, I think abortion should only be resorted to in cases of rape or if pregnancy causes abnormal health problems.","255":"*only\nUSA isn't perfect.
