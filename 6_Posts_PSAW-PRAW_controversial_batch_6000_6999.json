you post here saying you got banned from a certain subreddit for saying a certain opinion . im honestly just not gonna give a fuck about your post it makes you look like a complete idiot the community you got banned from shouldn't be witch hunted . getting intentionally banned from a subreddit is showing that your a complete loser yes some moderation teams are bad but i shouldn't waste my time clicking on a cry baby . most of your opinions are popular anyways this subreddit shouldn't fuel hate of other subreddits .","2":"It's funny how some people think that there is a 'new world order' that wants everyone to be gay or whatever conspiracy theory people come up it. Maybe USA is gearing towards that, maybe even western nation, but definitely not the entire world. If that did happen, countries wouldn't be over taken by the Taliban. Countries wouldn't be upping their punishments on 'liberalism'.   \nI just find the fear of 'liberalism' all very weird. I'm much scared of radical right wing Muslims than I am of the left. Don't get me wrong, left wing authoritarians that want to ban everything are very scary, but I'd say if they are a 99, the extreme conservatives (like Taliban) are a 100.","3":"[removed]","4":"The longer they last, the more bored and irritated you\u2019ll be with the person. Also, you need to sacrifice all other potential love interests. Why would you pass up so many exciting opportunities\n\nIt\u2019s way more satisfying to have an endless lineup of casual lovers. I can\u2019t think of any significant advantage to serious relationships. Why be tied down when you could be with whoever you want whenever you like?","5":"A game should be like Half-Life (linear), Metal Gear Solid (open areas, but linear story), Knights of the Old Republic (partially linear, partially open areas, and a story you can affect), or Elder Scrolls (open world, and open mission structure). \n\nWhat I hate is games that are like Metal Gear Solid 5, or the countless Call of Duty games. They consist of separate missions, and everything reset after each mission. The only two games that ever pulled this off is the original Halo and the 2016 Doom, and that is just because the whole game mechanics of Halo and Doom lends itself to individual missions. Halo and Doom aren't games about planning things well in advance, it's about raw combat.","6":"[removed]","7":"[removed]","8":"I think the first impressions that come to people's mind about the United States being a righteously prudish country are formed more thru media exposure and not actually thru living here. Also, by what metrics is Europe anymore sexually liberal? Porn is literally a black market in Poland, France has already considered limiting public access to nudist resorts, the UK awhile back banned skirts in public schools (didn't successfully get voted in, so its pointless citing that one), what about when Swedes took outrage to this kids' song about genitals themselves, while literally more Americans were actually showing support [see for yourself ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/yo_kW2jp63Q)\n\nIs America still to some degrees sexually repressive? Oh absolutely\n\nBut to what degree is the prudishness really in base American culture and not an influence from the puritans? Who LITERALLY CAME FROM BRITAIN \n\nYeah I remember the nipple outrage in the Super Bowl, I remember when hardcore conservatives back in the 90s wanted to ban porn, along with video games,  I remember when far right puriniticals complained about a gay wedding cake(which I changed my stance on completely)\n\nBut guess what? America, is a land of diversity of thought. This is because we're not a democracy, but a republic (traditionally speaking anyway).

Thankfully, Jesus died, and for some reason, that means if we accept him as our saviour, our souls are saved. This is true no matter what you've done. You could've spent your life persecuting Christians, murdering, raping, molesting, any of the most evil crimes, but if you ask Jesus Christ for forgiveness and to be your saviour, you're heaven bound by his mercy.\n\nHowever, one thing common in all the variants of Christianity I've seen is that fetuses, incapable of getting baptized or asking for forgiveness, go to heaven if they die, be it by miscarriage or abortion.\n\nBecause of this, we have two simple facts: if you, a non-Christian, get an abortion, you're no less hell-bound than if you didn't, so there's really no effect on where you'll end up, and if you later become Christian, you'll be going to heaven either way. Meanwhile, if you're aborted, you're definitely going to Heaven, while if you're born, there's a high chance, something like 68% if I recall, that you won't be Christian and will end up going to hell.\n\nHence, it's pretty clear: abortion is a net good. You're vastly reducing the fetuses chance of going to Hell and guaranteeing it heaven, at no cost to the mortal soul of the mother. The most objective good would be for a mother to have as many abortions as possible, as this creates the greatest number of souls that get to go to heaven and experience bliss, before eventually asking for forgiveness. Hell, even if God gets annoyed at this loophole and refuses to forgive the woman, one soul going to Hell for the dozens of aborted souls going to heaven far outweighs the cost.\n\nThis is all predicated on Christian theology being correct, of course, and falls away with out it, but it's an interesting argument I've never seen addressed.","14":"[removed]","15":"[removed]","16":"[removed]","17":"[removed]","18":"[removed]","19":"[removed]","20":"He was sent here to fan the flames of culture war, sow distrust in our democracy, and destroy our nation from within. This is my opinion, and I\u2019m not pretending to have conclusive evidence, but here are the reasons why I believe this:\n\nIn 2016, his campaign officials and family members met with Russians in Trump tower for the purpose of exchanging \u201cdirt\u201d on his opponent. Whether anything came of this or not, the parties involved admit that the meeting occurred and didn\u2019t deny what the purpose of the meeting was. It\u2019s unlikely that this is the first time the two sides made contact. This meeting lines up with a pattern of behavior that either directly or indirectly supports the Russian agenda of weakening America from within. \n\n[Throughout 2016, Trump claimed the election would be rigged](https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.bbc.com\/news\/election-us-2016-37673797.amp)\n\nAfter his victory, he abandoned the election fraud claims and continued to work for Russia from the Oval Office. He supported Russia\u2019s agenda abroad, withdrawing support for Ukraine and the Kurds. He also publicly supported Putin\u2019s agenda and had a much less contentious relationship with Putin than any former president. \n\nWhile in office he criticizes free press. Anytime the media is critical of him, he calls it \u201cfake news\u201d. His campaign against the media is meant push people to listing to and trusting him (the government) for information, rather than the free press which does not have to respond to the government. He also wants to compel right-winged media to tailor their reports to not upset him, causing him to tell his supporters to change the channel. If the media has to concern itself with the president\u2019s opinion before running a story, they are not free press anymore. Russian media responds to the government, American media has always only responded to one thing: money. \n\nThroughout his time in office and the election cycle (which doesn\u2019t truly end for Trump, since he continues to do campaign-style rallies even outside of the normal election cycle) he campaigns on the idea that the other side will destroy the country, and specifically his supporters way of life, if he loses. He tells people they should fear being replaced by immigrants and those who want \u201cdiversity\u201d. \n\nAlso throughout 2019 and 2020, he regularly said that even after he wins, he should be allowed a 3rd term because of how \u201cpoorly he was treated\u201d. Many people dismissed this as a joke, but there are many supporters who would only vote for him and would definitely support a 3rd term. He wants to remain in office as long as possible. \n\nIn 2020, the election fraud claims came back and when he lost, he claimed the election was stolen from him. He told supporters to gather at the Capitol and convince congress to overturn the election, which is not something the rules allow them to do. All of his attempts to overturn the election from Election Day to January 6th would have been unconstitutional. \n\nNow, he sends out emails to his supporters saying that if we don\u2019t \u201csolve\u201d the 2020 election fraud, republicans won\u2019t vote in 2022 or 2024. This is a message to his supporters that there\u2019s no reason to partake in American democracy, and a message to Republican politicians that if they don\u2019t support his election fraud campaign, he will turn against them. He is also isolating members of the Republican Party who don\u2019t believe the election was stolen, creating a party of people who don\u2019t trust anyone in government or media besides him. \n\nHe is currently holding \u201csave America\u201d rallies, entirely focused on the \u201cissue\u201d of solving the stolen 2020 election. All of his actions push us closer and closer to civil war. There are millions of people on the \u201cright\u201d who believe our country is already lost and democracy is broken, but that\u2019s simply not true at this point. If we allowed him to have his way and Congress\/Mike Pence unconstitutionally overturn the results of the election, their fears would have come true. \n\nThe Cold War never ended, the battleground just changed. Russia is the same government that wants to be their region\u2019s unopposed superpower, and America is still a roach for them that\u2019s impossible to kill with violence or the threat of violence. What\u2019s the best way to destroy the most diverse superpower in the world? Use that diversity against them and make them fight themselves. Re-ignite the flames of the Civil War and the unresolved conflicts between different factions. I\u2019m confident that Trump isn\u2019t the only Russian agent in our government, but he is certainly the most effective. He is by far the most polarizing figure in America today and the disruption he causes is exactly what the Russian government wants.","21":"These people have already tried to overthrow a free and fair election.

This seems to echo the feelings of many RP, tradcon and general manosphere types.  \n\nThis didn\u2019t make sense to me \u2014 if you believe women are best equipped for childrearing, why should the courts side in favor of a father who is not even involved in the kids education?

Idc if you call everyone who disagrees with you a bigot, something being politically correct doesn't magically make it empirically correct, period.

Well, we have a lot of sources, including Roman historians and early multiple Christian authors.  At least a dozen.\n\nIn fact our problem isn't a lack of information it's too much really - one source says he was stoned, another stoned and beaten , and another just says he was beaten.  There's also some confusion because there was multiple people named James.  But on the main points, there is widespread agreement.\n\n\n##Jesus \n\nOn to Jesus.  Of course, we have the Christian sources - the four Gospels, any of which would be considered primary source material.  Then we have the Roman historians, Tacitus and Josephus.  These aren't just random guys - Tacitus was a Governor, Senator, and even a Consul, and Josephus worked for Emperor Titus.\n\nBoth Tacitus and Josephus are in agreement on the main points - Jesus Christ taught and founded Christianity,  was condemned by Herod (Pontius Pilate), and crucified by the Romans.  Josephus also confirms the baptism of Jesus (by John the Baptist). Bottom line is that you can doubt some of the details, but you can't doubt that Jesus existed unless you deliberately apply an impossible high standard to him, specifically.\n\n##Resurrection\n\nOk, fair enough, you're thinking, so Jesus was a real guy who was baptized, started a new religion, and was crucified.  But there's no evidence that he performed miracles, or was resurrected, right?  RIGHT?\n\nHaving multiple eyewitness accounts of a historical event that was witnessed by dozens or even hundreds of people is a historians dream, and that's exactly where we are on the resurrection.  According to the gospels, the tomb was empty, and Jesus made as many as five appearances to his family members, disciples, and even a crowd of people.  And according to Josephus, yes Jesus did rise from the dead, so that's third-party (non-Christian) confirmation.\n\nIf it wasn't the resurrection, nobody would doubt it's authenticity..

It would be the same with a woman that only has sons.\n\nI personally hope I will have a son in the future, but that doesn't mean it would be a problem for me if I end up only having daughters.","74":"[deleted]","75":"[removed]","76":"[removed]","77":"[removed]","78":"[removed]","79":"I've been kissed 4 times. 2 times out of 4 they just grabbed my face.

Da Baby claimed self defense in the shooting, what he did on stage lambasting gay people was just unprovoked and vile. \n\nlike with anything, as time passes, society evolves and society has evolved past the LGBTQ+ community being punchlines just like we\u2019ve evolved past black and other POC being punchlines. his jokes just don\u2019t really cater to the current climate of what\u2019s funny anymore and he refuses to let shit go and come up with better material \n\nalso spoiler; at the end he talks about his *one* trans friend but he exploits her story and suicide as his gotcha moment in attempt to show he isn\u2019t transphobic while even calling himself a transphobe.\n\nhis old friend and co writer Neil Brennan on his podcast even says dave is a drama queen when it comes to stuff like this. \n\nto be honest; his comedy just seems repetitive and lazy now. like he\u2019s the bully who is shocked when someone fights back. he said this last special would be his last and i really hope it isn\u2019t but i hope ig and when he comes back his material won\u2019t rely solely on gay people and cancel culture.","87":"It's just strange to me when government adds on increases in mortgage rates or whatever people are like 'I have no choice but to increase my rent, it's not my fault'.

It's not broken, it's not malicious, and it isn't at fault for your bad spending habits.\n\nCapitalism at its core is based on the idea of economic freedom. Freedom is not a regulation nor a solution. It is the natural state of any economy before rules and regulations are applied. Capitalism allows room for prosperity for anyone, and poverty for anyone. It envelops both the good and the bad.\n\nIn my opinion, you all should be hating on Communism and Corporatism. Corporations strongly resemble Communist states in that they aggregate resources under singular, draconic control, and have very little or impersonal regard for their members and employees. Everything is done with the interest of the Company (under the pretense of everyone benefitting) in mind. That's a Communist state.\n\nUnder Capitalism, anything can happen. You could thrive, or you could fall. It's up to you and chance. It's not the fault of Capitalism if you let corporations buy all the land and houses, and then rent them out at an extortionate premium. If you don't like it, don't sell.\n\nCapitalism allows for those things, but it also allows for you to legislate local (state level) laws on land ownership, as well as setting the value of the property low and using Eminent Domain to buy it all back for pennies on the dollar.\n\nYou can't blame economic tyranny on economic freedom.","90":" \n\nI was watching this video that was from a while back of a woman on a NJ Transit train who was sitting in one seat,  and her Louis Vuitton was parked in the seat next to her. \n\nPeople  were giving her a hard time because she wasn't allowing anyone to sit  next to her. She kept on saying \"I want my personal space, I don't want  you sitting next to me.\"\n\nApparently this minor debacle was enough  to cause the conductor to stop the train so transit police can escort  her off the train.\n\nI'm sorry, but this annoys me like hell.

When  it comes to open seats on trains, everyone keeps on trying to say \"if  you want to put your bag in a seat, pay for two seats\" or the  ever-infamous \"I paid for a ticket, I'm entitled to a seat.\"\n\nSorry,  but the \"I paid for a ticket\" argument is stupid. EVERYONE paid for a  ticket. The only thing it entitles you to is to be transported from one  station to the next. That's it, no more no less.\n\n2. There are  other seats available, always.  I suggest you try somewhere else instead  of DEMANDING that one person let you sit next to them. As rude as she  sounded, she's right. If she doesn't want someone sitting next to her,  she has every right to say no. She's entitled to her personal space, and  the fact that \"it's public transportation\" is not relevant. \n\n3.  Why did the person recording it even see it fit to record to begin with?  Doesn't she have anything better to do aside from shaming someone for  not thinking the way she thinks? This is America. People have choices,  and just because someone chooses to do something that isn't what you  want them to do doesn't mean you get to embarrass them for it.\n\n**Louder for those in the back:**\n\n***If you pay for a ticket, you are not entitled to a seat.***\n\n***Paying for a ticket entitles you and your possessions on hand to be transported from one station to another.*** \n\n***Your ticket doesn't entitle you a seat, it doesn't even entitle you to get off at your intended destination station.

Globalism by its very nature, as a product of it's far reach and impact, is one of the most significant factors polluting the oceans, the air, the land and environmental systems. You cannot, with any intellectual honesty, say you support globalism while also claiming you want to improve issues with climate change and environmental degradation. However, despite this, it is very common today to run across people who claim they want to improve the environment, but then at the same time advocate for unrestrained globalism.

I'm Italian and, you know, not so good English skills.\n\nThis though that I have has formed seeing how ignorant and uncultured are most of the elderly people in my country. They can't elaborate a personal way of thinking that isn't \"imposed\" by someone else.\nFor example:\nSalvini is the leader of Lega, one of the top parties in Italy. _\"Boomers\"_ follows him just because their minds are too lazy to elaborate what he's actually saying.\n10 years ago Salvini was supporting Padanian secession and he said that Italy is a shithole of a country, that southern Italians are fucking pigs and things like that. Nowadays he's a ultranationalist who loves southern Italy and that says that people from Africa are fucking pigs and stuff like that. Basically he's followed and he got lot of consent because he know what people want and he says what people want.\n\nSalvini isn't the only party leader to do this. Also PD (Italian democratic party), M5S (populists), Fratelli d'Italia (ultra right wing) and Forza Italia (Right market liberals) are fucking shitty parties that decieve ignorant people to follow them just because they know what to tell to electors.\n\nI saw lot of young people (18-30) that fucking hate this system. 7 out of 10 people that are under 30 don't vote anymore.\nThey're fucking tired of those parties that exist only because _\"boomers\"_ vote them.\n\nWe can't have a fucking good party that says the truth and that want what is truly good for Italy.\n\nNowadays Italian politics can be summarized in:\n\n\"Left\"wing: Lmao those Right-wing fuckers are dumb as hell, they're fascists.\n\nRightwing: Lmao those Left-wing fuckers are so fucking stupid, they're commies.\n\nItaly don't have a true Left-wing anymore, Even PD (top \"left\"wing party) it's a fucking joke. They're considered _LeFt_ because they support LGBT rights. Nothing more. That's all.\n\nWe don't have a good Socialist\/Communist party since the current ones always do things just to have 2-3 seats in the parliament. They care about the seats not the people.\nWe don't have a good liberal party since the current one is a fucking joke that cares only about free market and dont give a shit about civil rights.\nWe don't have a good rightwing conservative party since the current ones only cares to spread shit about immigrants and to exploit that sort of \"Boomer's-Nostalgia\" that most of over60 have.\n\nOur political system is fucked up because parties only point to recieve votes from ignorant, dumb, lazyminds _\"boomers\"_ that can't understand what kind of shit they're voting.\n\nIn Italy, the elderly are the largest demographic category and the most ignorant. Less than 50% of them have a highschool degree and school before highschool only teaches you how to write, basic math and 0 to none literature.\n\nI'm not surprised to see my country rolling down to the bottom of the abyss if we give to those dumbfucks that can't even speak properly the right to vote.\n\nVote it's not only a right, it's also a responsibility. You're fucking asked to decide the future of a country. Don't get surprised if populists are winning. They talk to the stomach of ignorant people that electorally worth as much as you.

It's borderline abuse.","150":"I make an effort to stay informed on the opinions of those on the left and the right. One of the ways I do this is by watching content creators on youtube from all across the political sphere. When I do this, I try to find the most reasonable who can put together the best arguments to represent different viewpoints.\n\nThere are a couple problems. For one, the overtun window keeps shifting further and further right. It's a key, and very effective, part of the fascist\u2019s strategy. This means that more and more people, without their actual views changing at all, are being labelled left leaning when they were previously considered right leaning.\n\nThe second problem is the one alluded to in the title, and it's pretty closely related to the first. People keep being pushed out of right wing social groups for having opinions that even slightly differ from the group, or for incredibly petty stuff that either has nothing to do with politics or is informed by their right wing views. Stuff\u2019s crazy.\n\nFor example, when righties accuse me of being left wing for watching people like Young Turks, I point out how I also watch people like Neo-Nazis and QAnon. Now don't get me wrong, all of these people believe a lot of crazy and incredibly stupid stuff, but they at least make fully formed arguments for their beliefs (less so with QAnon, but he's the best evangelical politics guy I've found so I can't ditch him).\n\nHowever, Liz Cheney has been canceled for not falling for the Big Lie, and it's only a matter of time before Mitt Romney gets cancelled for being a pedo or some stuff. Now people are calling Liz forking Deep State and the only people these days who are considered right wing are the clinically insane people on YouTube like PragerU.\n\nAnd that's kind of the point. By shunning anyone but the most extreme, they push the overtun window further and further which makes normies thing the extreme views are more normal, so they adopt them more.\n\nI consider myself a centrist. I have very strong views on most major political topics, but they don't align with either the left or the right. Sometimes I agree with things that are strictly right wing ideas, and sometimes I agree with things that are strictly left wing. But having said that, the right really is toxic as hell. The left always seems to be the more understanding and reasonable side. I'm not going to just start agreeing with them because they're nice, but it is worth pointing out.","151":"So whenever we are going to listen to music in school, 90% of the boys want to listen to rap and hip hop only.

But to be honest, throughout my research and gathering of this process... I am willing to accept every outcome headed my way.\n\nAfter looking around at r\/HermanCainAward, especially with it's growth (whether by the recent articles or not), as a fond person of researching I decided to tackle the claims the people make that say that sub is bad because it celebrates death. This is accompanied by them stating that it breaks the rules of Reddit. Mainly Rule 1. So in order to tackle these claims, I present to you this post.\n\nFirst let's go over, **Rule 1**\n\n>Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. ***Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.***\n\n[Inciting violence](https:\/\/www.reddithelp.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360043513151) and [the hate sections](https:\/\/www.reddithelp.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360045715951) have hyperlinks in them so they can provide examples in terms of context.\n\nThis is what people who dislike the sub form their basis on breaking ToS. This rule thanks to it's last section on both grounds. So now let's dissect them one by one.\n\nFirst, **inciting violence**. To incite by definition [thanks to webster](https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/incite#:~:text=transitive%20verb,up%20%3A%20spur%20on%20%3A%20urge%20on), it is to encourage, urge, or stir up. Is the sub encouraging Anti-Vaxxers to die? No, absolutely not. The majority of the posts are post screen caps which critique anti-vaxxers and showcase how COVID disinformation kills. The posts with the caps are catalogued in chronological order, starting from people believing in disinformation about COVID to either their demise or their realization. How is basing something off of a poster showcasing another persons history \"inciting violence\"?\n\nThis is the easiest to debunk. How easy? Is the OP of the post voicing their opinion of them? No. It's just their history. The fact they have no thoughts about the person and that they are showcasing the person's life is not encouraging violence. If that's the case, most history subs would be banned\n\nIf you still don't believe me, go into any of the posts and look at the criteria I posed. As in look back at that same webster definition and see if it applies to comments.\n\nPlus consider the second rule of that sub, which is \"don't root for nominees to be awarded\". If that comment is inciting, the mods will report it and take it down because that's wishing death, promoting it, which is against Reddit's rules. They know that comments that promote death can get banned, plus [considering the nature that this sub doesn't want to exist but because of them are anyway](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/HermanCainAward\/comments\/psyp4w\/for_those_who_say_the_hca_are_immoral_lets_see\/), it's right for them to do to enforce that rule.\n\nNext, **hate based on identity**. How Reddit identifies hate by identity falls under these categories and I quote;\n\n>based on their actual and perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, or disability. These include victims of a major violent event and their families.\u00a0\n\nThis other bad faith argumentation of the sub is on the grounds of their own political identity, because apparently it is now a political side. This is tricky to dissect. While one could argue political identity being a part of the many examples of hate on identity, I argue against that.\n\nIf we want to go further into this let's look at the possible counter-argument, [did you know that companies can deny you because of your political beliefs?](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tomspiggle\/2021\/02\/24\/is-political-discrimination-in-the-workplace-legal\/?sh=7778d88c68dd) [This extends more to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.](https:\/\/www.eeoc.gov\/statutes\/title-vii-civil-rights-act-1964) This would be a no-shit moment if you've been banned in political subs where your ideals are different from the majority but this is reality. That is not the case with here.\n\nWhy not? If I am honest, while I can make a case that a company denying a person thanks to their political views is discrimination, in a case like this subreddit and other related areas to it, it's very different.\n\nOne is a job that require humans to work for to ensure their livelihood, the other is just a club with no purpose. One is about working for change for your right to paycheck, the other is goofing off. You see? One is client to client for their needs, the other is just not about the needs and is only one-party.\n\nThat sub is that other. It's not providing needs to other people out of necessity. Jobs vs subs are very different.\n\nAlso for the main meat to connect this; political identity's change over time as we grow and develop new takes on situations, one idea today could be a bad one later. Political affiliations swing from human to human as we get older or we get exposed to new identity's. To put it bluntly, the things Reddit listed such as race, identity, gender, sex, disability are all things we can't change. Political affiliation we can change. So why discriminate when we can change affiliations?\n\nThe virus has no political sides, this virus took the left and the right, even some anti-vaxxers are left wings too but very very rarely is that the case. Even if the majority is the opposition, it's not hate because you can change it. If you can't change it and that's your personality\/life\/body, it's hate. That's in layman's terms Reddit provided.\n\nTL;DR: That sub **does not** violate Reddit ToS. The incitement is not there, and the hatred is non-existent. That sub is all a PSA about how disinformation in today's society can kill by showcasing a person's life. Call it a memorial, call it a scared straight message, but it isn't a place to dance at deaths.\n\nAlso I find it ironic that for people on Reddit who hate this sub (mainly some on the opposition) are also Free Speech Warriors. It's funny really, you claim to support Free Speech but be willing to ban this sub... That's funny.","196":"[deleted]","197":"Everyone likes to shit on fortnite but I have a blast playing it.

Sometimes, it's for some crazy shit PETA is doing, but for the vast majority of times, it's clear people just enjoy getting annoyed or angry at vegans easier. It's never made sense to me. Veganism isn't a choice that effects other people. If anything, given veganism has less of an environmental impact, it's considerably better for those around you to be vegan.\n\nYet, the anger persists. Why? Well, it's pretty simple. People feel insecure, because they're aware that meat-eating is the ethically worse option. Meat-eating is unhealthier, it hurts the environment and it leads to all that disgusting, sadistic shit that we put animals through. And, let's be honest... at this point, we're all aware of that fact. The evidence is so overwhelming that anyone who denies veganism is better is just doing some premium coping, and it's honestly so pathetic.\n\nIf you want to eat meat, feel free. People make bad choices all the time, that's human nature. I don't particularly care either way. It's the weakness I see in a lot of meat-eaters that annoys me. The inability to just be strong and stand by the choices you make, rather than having to lie and pretend you're not picking the worse option. It's like a smoker trying to still argue \"Smoking actually helps, look at this study from the 1860s!\" Honestly, it's embarrassing.\n\nOh, and not that it's relevant to the opinion, but I'm not a vegan. Meat is absolutely delicious, especially in a nice BBQ. I'm about to eat some pulled pork in a sandwich right now. I recognize veganism as the better option, but so is not smoking when I drink, and I don't do that either. We're all only human.","199":"[removed]","200":"[removed]","201":"[removed]","202":"I see a lot of people including some \"leftists\" that think that the left is trying to cancel anyone who makes an offensive joke, and I don't think that's the case anymore.

They think that making a offensive joke on a public forum, like twitter, can\n\n 1: turn people into believing nazism or racist ideologies\n\n 2: makes nazis or racists feel safe\n\n3: can offend random people scrolling\n\nMaking an offensive joke around friends is fine. No one wants to cancel that. Making a jew joke around friends ain't gonna turn them into nazis, or make them feel safe to be a nazi because they aren't nazis. The joke also probably wouldn't offend your friends.

Today we have the United Nations, and although today it doesn\u2019t really do much besides some aid work, the foundation for a one world government is already here.\n\n\nIf you think that it\u2019s impossible because the world is too divided, look at the European Union. 80 years ago Europe was still a war zone, with all the little countries fighting for dominance. Today, all of Western Europe essentially functions as one nation, to great benefit of its members. Yeah, the UK left, and it\u2019s been a disaster. England trying to play empire again like it\u2019s 1912.

Racism is seen as wrong and immoral... but discrimination based on nationality is common place. Almost everyone seems to agree it's fine.\n\nPretty simply, the reason racism is bad is because you're discriminating against someone for a characteristic of their birth that they did not choose and that has no effect on their character. Another characteristic that fits that exact same field? Nationality.\n\nPeople would have an outcry if a patient was denied service because he was white or black, but the notion that illegal immigrants not only don't deserve healthcare, but should have their kids taken away and be kicked out of the country is commonplace. There's a debate over how inhumane the discrimination should be, but near everyone agrees it's justified.\n\nI see people get offended by this opinion, and it's certainly very unpopular. But honestly? Not once have I ever seen an actual argument, let alone a rational one, for this discrimination.\n\nHonestly, I'm sure that in the future, we'll look back on this as a barbaric practice that we're glad we abolished.","212":"\u201cSticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me\u201d.

If the virus mutates and the spike protein is what is mutated, vaccinated individuals will technically be unvaccinated again (thus requiring boosters) and those with natural immunity will fight the virus much more efficiently because their immune systems have been exposed to *all* of the virus. It's scientifically called \"[active immunity](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccines\/vac-gen\/immunity-types.htm)\" and the science community has agreed since the beginning of time that it offers almost life-long protection.\n\nNone of these mandates\/vaccine passports make sense with what we know about this virus and the vaccines.

I believe the exact opposite. The strong, smart, brave, and competent have a duty to help those less fortunate than themselves. Putting them under pressure rarely works as a way to help such people stand on their own feet, notwithstanding inspirational motivation stories. In fact, it's more likely to make them less effectual, due to raising the price for so-called self-improvement (I say so-called because my idea of self-improvement is moral and ethical, of which money, power, sex appeal, popularity, glory-getting, community status and prestige is no substitute). With that said, I'll go on to my reasons I don't take either those phrases seriously, and even say that victim-blaming is immoral in and of itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-  Confuses *inability* to stop or reverse a bad thing with *willfully allowing* a bad thing happen (\"letting\", a usual synonym for allowing, is also victim-blaming)\n\n\\- Fails to see that sometimes lack of bad intent *does* excuse undesirable outcomes, even if other times it's no \"Get Out Of Jail Free\" card.\n\n\\- Shifts responsibility on people least able to handle the difficulty,  thereby putting an unreasonable burden on the person (How can you be responsible for something if you're unable to deal with it?)\n\n\\- Sees responsibility itself more in terms of *favorable results*, rather than taking an unsuccessful action against the bad thing.\n\n\\- Ignores the unique details of the person's life experience that caused him or her to take either no or insufficient action to stop the bad thing, This includes repeated experiences of even worse treatment or scorn for actually trying and failing than if they didn't try at all (which, let's face it, is not exactly a rare reaction from onlookers).\n\n\\-Shoehorns the average person's abilities and talents into the victim, thus making a false comparison.\n\n\\- Irrationally shames victimhood itself when the victim clearly lacked intent to do a bad thing to anyone. This implies the blamer has either crude understandings of free will or vastly underestimates either (a) the bad consequences of a failed effort to stop a bad thing\n\nAnd these are why I find \"Toughen Up!\", \"Don't be stupid!\" as supposed motivators or otherwise \"cures\" for another person's shortcommings a joke.  Only detailed sympathetic back and forth conversations can even begin to alleviate any supposed problem.

It's the same us-them mentality that drives it, eliminating independent thought and ideas.\n\nThere are no sides. And judging from the state of human rights in America, the real enemies are the ones taking any humans rights away regardless of gender, sex, race, ethnic, etc. There are claims that human rights are being stripped thanks to Republican Party. They are not one sided, I\u2019ve seen both sides limit and take away human rights on both ends of the spectrum. And before you piss your pants and say this is centrist talk, yeah fucking right, \u201ccentrism\u201d is a dumb buzzword to eliminate the idea of independent political thinkers who have solutions that are wildly different from both sides.\n\nAlso the amount of hypocrisy, GOOD GOD, it\u2019s even MORE proof we run on party over country. Most of these \"sides\" only care about these issues if it benefits their party, cases in point:\n\nThose free speech warriors; Like banning TikTok over no proof and all misinformation all because its user base criticized the right and those warriors tried to slander the company then promote GETTR who actively censors the left ([including this group who debunks the TikTok misinfomation](https:\/\/gettr.com\/post\/p2evef)).\n\nThose Blue Lives Matter who stormed the capitol gunning down the police that they themselves \u201clove so much\u201d. Holy fuck, even the police killed one and these people made that person the hero while pissing over George Floyd to shill police love when they also shill the \u201chero\u201d who got gunned down by police. I think her name was... Ashli Babbitt?\n\nAnd these two are just the beginning!\n\nHell I don\u2019t think they gave a shit about China or Russia or now with Afghanistan and the Taliban, they just use it as a buzzword for validation but do NOTHING to solve the issue. For instance: As much as everyone on Reddit \u201chates\u201d China, THE SIDES HAVEN\u2019T DONE SHIT. Why don\u2019t they just make a change by protesting over there and promote country over party by realizing that party\u2019s do jack and making the US known there?\n\nYep I said it, those are keyboard warriors. I guess all these party\u2019s can do is comment China and Russia Bad and be all talk and no bite. Pussies is the better term.\n\nYes. Them bad. But are they doing something about it besides posting a comment on reddit for feeling validation? No. Posting it to promote your party by being a slacktivist? Yes. The sides care about their issues if it benefits them, and not everyone. They care about themselves. That's what these sides do! It's a ploy to destroy civil discourse and democracy!\n\nYes, it is all that it is, performative slacktivism! They NEVER gave a FUCK about any issue, they just promote it and IGNORE it to promote your PARTY. Hell even then, these guys will spew misinformation no matter the side to promote your ideology.\n\nThey care about CLOUT and CLOUT alone to fuel the division instead of CHANGE.\n\nSpeaking of which...\n\nI understand we have a lot of questions about the law, but FUCK we have a lot of case laws set in place that they ignore under the guise of \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cpropaganda\u201d. Critical thinking and research is dead, these \"sides\" want to be reinforced. And that\u2019s the worst part, each sides ideology has multiple influences for both parties and you have to pick the side who has the most ideologies that you want to see change. It\u2019s lesser of the two evils and it promotes THIS. This toxic team battle that ends up killing rational, civil, and respectful discussion that you fuckers, no matter the side, think it\u2019s for the fucking \u201cgreater good\u201d.\n\nThere is no LEFT and there is no RIGHT. The true enemy is the politicians killing your human rights. We should come together to fight the evils. And care for the things you love.","249":"[removed]","250":"My dad needed emergency care because of a burn on his chest and arms, but there was no proper bed available, so we had to take the shitty home are option, which increases recovery time by 2 weeks.\n\nYou know why there were no beds?

Obesity is a serious problem in the First World, and it's something we're going to need to deal with. I'm not saying that we should treat obesity as a positive, nor should we encourage it. \n\nHowever, we need to teach fat people to love themselves, and their bodies, so that they can improve upon them. After all, one can love something while acknowledging it has faults, and if anything, loving something is going to make you much more likely to dedicate the effort to fix those faults.\n\nWe can see that with how damaging the inverse, fat shaming, is. It's been proven time after time to be ineffective, because shame makes people eat.

Anyone who suggests this as a solution is either just really stupid, or doesn't care about actually helping and just wants to try make themselves feel better for their own weaknesses.\n\nThe solution isn't to make fat people hate their bodies. We need to teach fat people to love their bodies. Not to think their bodies are perfect, mind you, but to see that their bodies are something worthy of love and something that should be improved upon. People need to be pushed towards change in a positive way that doesn't just make them feel like crap and eat more.\n\nThis is far from the only problem, of course. There's a lot of other factors in play here, like how fatty foods are often cheaper, how corporations can obscure what is and isn't healthy and, of course, people just being stupid and not taking into account how they're destroying their bodies.\n\nBut the evidence is in. Shaming doesn't work, and we need to take the other road.","259":"The rest shouldn't be taxed it should be forced to spend on anything I don't care boat's, paintings, charity, back into someone's business...

They don't want to get the vaccine because they don't trust this experimental vaccine. I felt like playing Russian roulette by taking it, and I'm still not convinced that I made the right move.\n\nSo, I don't, give an unvaccinated person a few thousands dollars IF YOU WANT (self-entitled as you are) people to get vaccinated because you still live in the delusional wonderland where if everyone gets vaccinated we would be already done with the pandemic...
